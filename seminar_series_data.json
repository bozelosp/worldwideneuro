After all, Pavlov was mostly interested in digestive glands, but nevertheless ended up being most famous for his contributions to neuroscience. Now more than ever, there is a lot of fascinating science happening at the interface of neuroscience with other biological disciplines. The interaction of the nervous system with metabolism and organ physiology, immunology, reproduction, aging, and cancer, are only a few of the current fertile grounds where neuroscience meets new fields. We decided to term work integrating neuroscience with other biological fields brain-body interactions. Importantly, the integration of neuroscience with other domains of biology not only enables new discoveries, but also allows us to understand how complex interactions within organisms shape emerging properties at the whole-organism level. As such, the insights obtained through such work are key to tackle important challenges ranging from medicine, to nutrition, and food security.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis virtual seminar series on brain-body interactions aims to bring together scientists interested in exploring this interface, coming from neuroscience or other fields of biology. By providing an open and integrative forum, we aim at bringing together researchers with a neuroscience background interested in exploring new topics, and colleagues who normally do not work on the nervous system but are interested in learning more about ideas and concepts from neuroscience. As such, we ask our speakers and audience to keep an open mind and an inquiring spirit, and to leave behind the jargon which would normally be suitable for very specialized audiences.\"", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "active": true}, "NeuroPhilosophy of Free Will": {"Series Name": "NeuroPhilosophy of Free Will", "Organized by": [{"text": "Neuroscience and Philosophy of Free Will", "url": "https://neurophil-freewill.org/"}], "Banner Image": "", "About this Series": "We are a group of 17 neuroscientists and philosophers have been collaboratively investigating how the brain enables conscious, causal control of decision making and action formation as part of a large, interdisciplinary and international grant.", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "active": true}, "Neuro Light Lunch": {"Series Name": "Neuro Light Lunch", "Organized by": [{"text": "Canadian Neurophotonics Platform (", "url": "http://neurophotonics.ca"}], "Banner Image": "https://neurophotonics.ca/sites/default/files/neuropho_cent_color_rgb_lo.png", "About this Series": "This series will highlight 8 rising stars of Canadian neurophotonics with two 30 min talks each week.

Talks will continue on a monthly basis with a short break over the summer. \"\"The last decade has seen phenomenal advances in the field of machine learning (AI) (e.g. deep learning, reinforcement learning). Such is the change that no area of science can afford to ignore it, least of all neuroscience. Crucially, AI shares a common lineage with neuroscience, and provides a means to emulate neural functions and the circuits supporting them, delivering a normative understanding of the brain and cognition (e.g. Banino et al., 2018; Stringer et al. 2019; Dabney et al., 2020). Equally AI tools provide a means to discover, segment, and track distinct neural and behavioural states (e.g. Mathis et al., 2018; Frey et al., 2019) - yielding more efficient experiments and accelerating the pace of discovery. In turn, this understanding feeds back into the design of more effective AI architectures and models (e.g. Sabour et al., 2017; Stringer et al, 2019, Dabney et al., 2020). Essentially, AI problems posed in neuroscience both require and inspire further advances in AI.", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "active": true}, "neuroEYEscience": {"Series Name": "neuroEYEscience", "Organized by": [{"text": "Physiology Silesia", "url": "http://fizjologia.sum.edu.pl/?r=artykul/view&id=100"}], "Banner Image": "https://www.worldwideneuro.com/physio_silesia.png", "About this Series": "We are ocular neuroscience team from Department of Physiology, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland and here you will be able to find seminars related to newest findings in visual neuroscience, especially related to optic nerve structure and function in health and various diseases.
