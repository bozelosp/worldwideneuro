It is well-established that it depends on pre and postsynaptic activity. However, models that rely solely on pre and postsynaptic activity for synaptic changes have, to date, not been able to account for learning complex tasks that demand hierarchical networks. Here, we show that if synaptic plasticity is regulated by high-frequency bursts of spikes, then neurons higher in the hierarchy can coordinate the plasticity of lower-level connections. Using simulations and mathematical analyses, we demonstrate that, when paired with short-term synaptic dynamics, regenerative activity in the apical dendrites, and synaptic plasticity in feedback pathways, a burst-dependent learning rule can solve challenging tasks that require deep network architectures. Our results demonstrate that well-known properties of dendrites, synapses, and synaptic plasticity are sufficient to enable sophisticated learning in hierarchical circuits.", "calendar_event_hash": "08c7b2621395c7f69ac0eb554a4ad16f3ebfee9ad7f251640a4e4da88c4a6da1", "seminar_id": 2, "time_of_addition": "Wed, Mar 25, 2020 00:00"}, "3": {"seminar_date": "Fri, Jul 3, 2020", "seminar_time": "14:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Philipp Berens", "hosted_by": "Oxford Neurotheory", "seminar_link": "https://zoom.us/j/97641338531", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "theory,ML", "speaker_affil": "University of T\u00fcbingen", "speaker_twitter": "@CellTypist", "speaker_email": "philipp.berens[at]uni-tuebingen.de", "speaker_website": "http://www.eye-tuebingen.de/berens/", "seminar_title": "", "seminar_abstract": "", "calendar_event_hash": "b035d724132c0d260c8caf0fd72fb0d42e3d2842e3f08ccba8bd751d002ba01b", "seminar_id": 3, "time_of_addition": "Fri, Apr 17, 2020 19:00"}, "4": {"seminar_date": "Fri, Jun 12, 2020", "seminar_time": "14:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Timothy Lillicrap", "hosted_by": "Oxford Neurotheory", "seminar_link": "", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "theory, ML", "speaker_affil": "Google Deep Mind, University College London", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_email": "countzero@google.com", "speaker_website": "http://contrastiveconvergence.net/~timothylillicrap/index.php", "seminar_title": "", "seminar_abstract": "", "calendar_event_hash": "15c700adcb99fbf495e9e2c4f149a220c52bbd0b24f233fcf9e93e5cec45f503", "seminar_id": 4, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Apr 20, 2020 19:00"}, "5": {"seminar_date": "Fri, Jun 19, 2020", "seminar_time": "14:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "Dr.", "seminar_speaker": "Srdjan Ostojic", "hosted_by": "Oxford Neurotheory", "seminar_link": "https://zoom.us/j/176053962", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "theory", "speaker_affil": "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "speaker_twitter": "@ostojic_srdjan", "speaker_email": "srdjan.ostojic@ens.fr", "speaker_website": "https://lnc2.dec.ens.fr/en/member/655/srdjan-ostojic", "seminar_title": "", "seminar_abstract": "", "calendar_event_hash": "5fae3533b6d873da43a04c41ac0e893c190002752c989f2f46ba11fea3f6c986", "seminar_id": 5, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Mar 30, 2020 19:00"}, "6": {"seminar_date": "Fri, Jun 26, 2020", "seminar_time": "14:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Annegret Falkner", "hosted_by": "Oxford Neurotheory", "seminar_link": "https://zoom.us/j/411544451", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "behaviour,ephys", "speaker_affil": "Princeton University", "speaker_twitter": "@Neurrriot", "speaker_email": "afalkner@princeton.edu", "speaker_website": "https://www.falknerlab.com/", "seminar_title": "Mapping the neural dynamics of social dominance and defeat", "seminar_abstract": "", "calendar_event_hash": "e93426d53d9e7f64b135bb78d7f9e90a68d8f212ade8161ced79ccfb804bce17", "seminar_id": 6, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Mar 30, 2020 19:00"}, "7": {"seminar_date": "Fri, Jun 5, 2020", "seminar_time": "9:00", "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Kay Tye", "hosted_by": "Oxford Neurotheory", "seminar_link": "https://zoom.us/j/91900373067", "password": "1952", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "ephys, theory", "speaker_affil": "University of Calidformnia, San Diego", "speaker_twitter": "@kaymtye", "speaker_email": "tye@salk.edu", "speaker_website": "https://www.salk.edu/scientist/kay-tye/", "seminar_title": "", "seminar_abstract": "", "calendar_event_hash": "ede2820fefb4b58e5cfe213106d4ba114a06b06a75a53e8fa9f9504242a92bf7", "seminar_id": 7, "time_of_addition": "Fri, Apr 17, 2020 19:00"}, "93": {"seminar_date": "Fri, May 15, 2020", "seminar_time": "14:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "Dr", "seminar_speaker": "Daniela Vallentin", "hosted_by": "Oxford Neurotheory", "seminar_link": "https://www.crowdcast.io/e/daniela-vallentins-world", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "behaviour,ephys", "speaker_affil": "Max Planck Institute for Ornithology", "speaker_twitter": "@LabVallentin", "speaker_email": "danielavallentin@gmail.com", "speaker_website": "https://vallentinlab.com", "seminar_title": "Neural control of vocal interactions in songbirds", "seminar_abstract": "During conversations we rapidly switch between listening and speaking which often requires withholding or delaying our speech in order to hear others and avoid overlapping. This capacity for vocal turn-taking is exhibited by non-linguistic species as well, however the neural circuit mechanisms that enable us to regulate the precise timing of our vocalizations during interactions are unknown. We aim to identify the neural mechanisms underlying the coordination of vocal interactions. Therefore, we paired zebra finches with a vocal robot (1Hz call playback) and measured the bird\u2019s call response times. We found that individual birds called with a stereotyped delay in respect to the robot call. Pharmacological inactivation of the premotor nucleus HVC revealed its necessity for the temporal coordination of calls. We further investigated the contributing neural activity within HVC by performing intracellular recordings from premotor neurons and inhibitory interneurons in calling zebra finches. We found that inhibition is preceding excitation before and during call onset. To test whether inhibition guides call timing we pharmacologically limited the impact of inhibition on premotor neurons. As a result zebra finches converged on a similar delay time i.e. birds called more rapidly after the vocal robot call suggesting that HVC inhibitory interneurons regulate the coordination of social contact calls.  \n\nIn addition, we aim to investigate the vocal turn-taking capabilities of the common nightingale. Male nightingales learn over 100 different song motifs which are being used in order to attract mates or defend territories. Previously, it has been shown that nightingales counter-sing with each other following a similar temporal structure to human vocal turn-taking. These animals are also able to spontaneously imitate a motif of another nightingale. The neural mechanisms underlying this behavior are not yet understood. In my lab, we further probe the capabilities of these animals in order to access the dynamic range of their vocal turn taking flexibility.", "calendar_event_hash": "205582ab5b7bb2035dce48dfb1885a73d343081c95735c6f069ea49eaad9b2fc", "seminar_id": 93, "time_of_addition": "Wed, Mar 25, 2020 00:00"}, "9": {"seminar_date": "Fri, May 22, 2020", "seminar_time": "14:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Ann-Marie Oswald", "hosted_by": "Oxford Neurotheory", "seminar_link": "", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "theory, ephys", "speaker_affil": "University of Pitsburgh", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_email": "amoswald@pitt.edu", "speaker_website": "http://www.pitt.edu/~amoswald/", "seminar_title": "", "seminar_abstract": "", "calendar_event_hash": "31876067ea20d3f0fec59c0216adea7f65f2f9ec3e7ac772fc6ea1bba51d5957", "seminar_id": 9, "time_of_addition": "Sun, Mar 29, 2020 19:00"}, "75": {"seminar_date": "Fri, May 22, 2020", "seminar_time": "16:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "confirmed": "Yes", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "James O Olopade", "hosted_by": "SONA", "seminar_link": "https://forms.gle/CGtyGQkBFZexwkGVA", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "neuroanatomy, neurogenesis, neurodegeneration", "speaker_affil": "University of Ibadan", "speaker_twitter": "@SONAorg", "speaker_email": "sona.neuroscience@gmail.com", "speaker_website": "https://sonafrica.org/", "seminar_title": "Neuroscience Investigations in the Virgin Lands of African Biodiversity", "seminar_abstract": "Africa is blessed with a rich diversity and abundance in rodent and avian populations.

For this presentation, I will be showing studies in our lab, involving cellular neuroanatomy of two rodents, the African giant rat (AGR) and Greater cane rat (GCR), Eidolon Bats (EB) and also the Striped Owl (SO). Using histological stains (Cresyl violet and Rapid Golgi) and immunohistochemical biomarkers (GFAP, NeuN, CNPase, Iba-1, Collagen 2, Doublecortin, Ki67, Calbindin, etc), and Electron Microscopy, morphology and functional organizations of neuronal and glial populations of the AGR , GCR, EB and SO brains have been described, with our work ongoing. In addition, the developmental profiles of the prenatal GCR brains have been chronicled across its entire gestational period. Brains of embryos/foetuses were harvested for gross morphological descriptions and then processed using immunofluorescence biomarkers to determine the pattern, onset, duration and peak of neurogenesis (Pax6, Tbr1, Tbr2, NF, HuCD, MAP2) and the onset and peak of glial cell expressions and myelination in the prenatal GCR.

Recent advances in optogenetic techniques and mouse genetics now offer ways to specifically probe the functional properties of neural circuits with unprecedented specificity. Perhaps one of the most heavily interrogated circuits in the mouse brain is one in the retina that is involved in coding direction (reviewed by Mauss et al., 2017; Vaney et al., 2012). In this circuit, direction is encoded by specialized direction-selective (DS) ganglion cells (DSGCs), which respond robustly to objects moving in a \u2018preferred\u2019 direction but not in the opposite or \u2018null\u2019 direction (Barlow and Levick, 1965). We now know this computation relies on the coordination of three transmitter systems: glutamate, GABA and acetylcholine (ACh). In this talk, I will discuss the synaptic mechanisms that produce the spatiotemporal patterns of inhibition and excitation that are crucial for shaping directional selectivity. Special emphasis will be placed on the role of ACh, as it is unclear whether it is mediated by synaptic or non-synaptic mechanisms, which is in fact a central issue in the CNS.\r\nBarlow, H.B., and Levick, W.R.

Genetic sleep induction methods in animal models provide a powerful way to disambiguate these stages and functions, although behavioural methods alone are insufficient to accurately identify what kind of sleep is being engaged. In Drosophila, activation of the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) promotes sleep, but it remains unclear what kind of sleep this is, how the rest of the fly brain is behaving, or if any specific sleep functions are being achieved. Here, we developed a method to record calcium activity from thousands of neurons across a volume of the fly brain during dFB-induced sleep, and we compared this to the effects of a sleep-promoting drug. We found that drug-induced spontaneous sleep decreased brain activity and connectivity, whereas dFB sleep was not different from wakefulness. Paradoxically, dFB-induced sleep was found to be even deeper than drug- induced sleep. When we probed the sleeping fly brain with salient visual stimuli, we found that the activity of visually-responsive neurons was blocked by dFB activation, confirming a disconnect from the external environment. Prolonged optogenetic dFB activation nevertheless achieved a significant sleep function, by correcting visual attention defects brought on by sleep deprivation. These results suggest that dFB activation promotes a distinct form of sleep in Drosophila, where brain activity and connectivity remain similar to wakefulness, but responsiveness to external sensory stimuli is profoundly suppressed.", "calendar_event_hash": "0743dc996a717da42308ce259d73d5b5779dbb4b843b0fb6bbec01f0c3810a6a", "seminar_id": 17, "time_of_addition": "Sun, Apr 19, 2020 19:00"}, "18": {"seminar_date": "Thu, Apr 30, 2020", "seminar_time": "16:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "Sir Prof", "seminar_speaker": "David Klenerman", "hosted_by": "SONA", "seminar_link": "https://t.co/T7FF9f3bm6?amp=1", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "disease", "speaker_affil": "University of Cambridge", "speaker_twitter": "@UKDRI", "speaker_email": "", "speaker_website": "https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/dk10012", "seminar_title": "Watching single molecules in action: How this can be used in neurodegeneration", "seminar_abstract": "", "calendar_event_hash": "f7555486d19636ebc52248ce6407b60d144b0745f902c30dfc3c8bc7bd6debff", "seminar_id": 18, "time_of_addition": "Thu, Apr 23, 2020 19:00"}, "19": {"seminar_date": "Thu, Apr 30, 2020", "seminar_time": "17:00", "timezone": "Europe/Paris", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Franck Polleux", "hosted_by": "Geneva University", "seminar_link": "https://www.crowdcast.io/e/franck-polleuxs-world", "password": "1952", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "development, evolution", "speaker_affil": "Columbia University", "speaker_twitter": "@fpolleux", "speaker_email": "fp2304@cumc.columbia.edu", "speaker_website": "www.polleuxlab.com", "seminar_title": "A human-specific modifier of synaptic development, cortical circuit connectivity and function", "seminar_abstract": "The remarkable cognitive abilities characterizing humans has been linked to unique patterns of connectivity characterizing the neocortex. Comparative studies have shown that human cortical pyramidal neurons (PN) receive a significant increase of synaptic inputs when compared to other mammals, including non-human primates and rodents, but how this may relate to changes in cortical connectivity and function remained largely unknown. We previously identified a human-specific gene duplication (HSGD), SRGAP2C, that, when induced in mouse cortical PNs drives human-specific features of synaptic development, including a correlated increase in excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synapse density through inhibition of the ancestral SRGAP2A protein (Charrier et al. 2012; Fossatti et al. 2016; Schmidt et al. 2019). \r\nHowever, the origin and nature of this increased connectivity and its impact on cortical circuit function was unknown. I will present new results exploring these questions (see Schmidt et al. (2020) https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/852970v1). Using a combination of transgenic approaches and quantitative monosynaptic tracing, we discovered that humanization of SRGAP2C expression in the mouse cortex leads to a specific increase in local and long-range cortico-cortical inputs received by layer 2/3 cortical PNs. Moreover, using in vivo 2-photon imaging in the barrel cortex of awake mice, we show that humanization of SRGAP2C expression increases the reliability and selectivity of sensory- evoked responses in layer 2/3 PNs. We also found that mice humanized for SRGAP2C in all cortical pyramidal neurons and throughout development are characterized by improved behavioral performance in a novel whisker-based sensory discrimination task compared to control wild-type mice. \r\nOur results suggest that the emergence of SRGAP2C during human evolution underlie a new substrate for human brain evolution whereby it led to increased local and long-range cortico-cortical connectivity and improved reliability of sensory-evoked cortical coding. \r\nReferences cited \r\nCharrier C.*, Joshi K. *, Coutinho-Budd J., Kim, J-E., Lambert N., de Marchena, J., Jin W-L., Vanderhaeghen P., Ghosh A., Sassa T, and Polleux F.

Abstraction was defined operationally using the generalization performance of neural decoders across task conditions not used for training. This type of generalization requires a particular geometric format of neural representations. Neural ensembles in dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus, and in simulated neural networks, simultaneously represented multiple hidden and explicit variables in a format reflecting abstraction.

In particular, our aim is to uncover the principles underlying thalamocortical axonal wiring, maintenance and ultimately the rewiring of connections, through an integrated and innovative experimental programme. The development of the thalamocortical wiring requires a precise topographical sorting of its connections. Each thalamic nucleus receives specific sensory information from the environment and projects topographically to its corresponding cortical. A second level of organization is achieved within each area, where thalamocortical connections display an intra-areal topographical organization, allowing the generation of accurate spatial representations within each cortical area. Therefore, the level of organization and specificity of the thalamocortical projections is much more complex than other projection systems in the CNS. The central hypothesis of our laboratory is that thalamocortical input influences and maintains the functional architecture of the sensory cortices. We also believe that rewiring and plasticity events can be triggered by activity-dependent mechanisms in the thalamus. Three major questions are been focused in the laboratory: i) the role of spontaneous patterns of activity in thalamocortical wiring and cortical development, ii) the role of the thalamus and its connectivity in the neuroplastic cortical changes following sensory deprivation, and iii) reprogramming thalamic cells for sensory circuit restoration. Within these projects we are using several experimental programmes, these include: optical imaging, manipulation of gene expression in vivo, cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, cell culture, sensory deprivation paradigms and electrophysiology.

This prolonged development is thought to contribute in an important fashion to increased cortical size, but also enhanced circuit complexity and plasticity.

In the wild, rodents combine odor information with an internal spatial representation of the environment for foraging and navigation. What are the neural circuits in the brain that implement these behaviors? My research addresses this question by examining the synaptic circuits and neural population activity in the olfactory cortex to understand the integration of olfactory and spatial information. Primary olfactory (piriform) cortex (PCx) has long been recognized as a highly associative brain structure. What is the behavioral and functional role of these associative synapses in PCx? We designed an odor-cued navigation task, where rats must use both olfactory and spatial information to obtain water rewards. We recorded from populations of posterior piriform cortex (pPCx) neurons during behavior and found that individual neurons were not only odor-selective, but also fired differentially to the same odor sampled at different locations, forming an \u201colfactory place map\u201d. Spatial locations can be decoded from simultaneously recorded pPCx population, and spatial selectivity is maintained in the absence of odors, across behavioral contexts. This novel olfactory place map is consistent with our finding for a dominant role of associative excitatory synapses in shaping PCx representations, and suggest a role for PCx spatial representations in supporting olfactory navigation. This work not only provides insight into the neural basis for how odors can be used for navigation, but also reveals PCx as a prime site for addressing the general question of how sensory information is anchored within memory systems and combined with cognitive maps to guide flexible behavior.", "calendar_event_hash": "21a4cabbf3bb15edb2b7662d797bd66b0ad7cd03d2e453ccce04cc5be2fa8296", "seminar_id": 102, "time_of_addition": "Mon, May 11, 2020 22:18"}, "100": {"seminar_date": "Thu, May 14, 2020", "seminar_time": "16:00", "timezone": "America/New_York", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Guoping Feng", "hosted_by": "MIT Brain & Cog Sci", "seminar_link": "https://mit.zoom.us/j/92153793477", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "neurodevelopmental disorders, imaging, behavior, electrophysiology", "speaker_affil": "MIT Dept. of Brain and Cognitive Sciences", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_email": "", "speaker_website": "https://fenglaboratory.org/", "seminar_title": "Thalamic reticular nucleus dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders", "seminar_abstract": "The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), the major source of thalamic inhibition, is known to regulate thalamocortical interactions critical for sensory processing, attention and cognition.

In this talk, I will start with an example of how dysfunction of TRN contributes to attention deficit and sleep disruption using a mouse model of Ptchd1 mutation, which in humans cause neurodevelopmental disorder with ASD. Building on these findings, we further performed an integrative single-cell analysis linking molecular and electrophysiological features of the TRN to connectivity and systems-level function. We identified two subnetworks of the TRN with segregated anatomical structure, distinct electrophysiological properties, differential connections to the functionally distinct first-order and higher-order thalamic nuclei, and differential role in regulating sleep.

Prior studies in mouse models of Dravet syndrome (Scn1a+/- mice) at early developmental time points indicate that, in cerebral cortex, Nav1.1 is predominantly expressed in GABAergic interneurons (INs) and, in particular, in parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking basket cells (PV-INs). This has led to a model of Dravet syndrome pathogenesis whereby Nav1.1 mutation leads to preferential IN dysfunction, decreased synaptic inhibition, hyperexcitability, and epilepsy. We found that, at later developmental time points, the intrinsic excitability of PV-INs has essentially normalized, via compensatory reorganization of axonal Na+ channels. Instead, we found persistent and seemingly paradoxical dysfunction of putative disinhibitory INs expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP-INs). In vivo two-photon calcium imaging in neocortex during temperature-induced seizures in Scn1a+/- mice showed that mean activity of both putative principal cells and PV-INs was higher in Scn1a+/- relative to wild-type controls during quiet wakefulness at baseline and at elevated core body temperature. However, wild-type PV-INs showed a progressive synchronization in response to temperature elevation that was absent in PV-INs from Scn1a+/- mice immediately prior to seizure onset. We suggest that impaired PV-IN synchronization, perhaps via persistent axonal dysfunction, may contribute to the transition to the ictal state during temperature induced seizures in Dravet syndrome.", "calendar_event_hash": "76cf56506180e8a93166660458569295d38d8dff933491cd6f8b145e37daa921", "seminar_id": 35, "time_of_addition": "Wed, Nov 04, 2020 00:00"}, "101": {"seminar_date": "Tue, May 12, 2020", "seminar_time": "11:30", "timezone": "America/New_York", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "", "seminar_speaker": "Benjamin Dichter, Ryan Ly, Andrew Tritt, Pam Baker, and Oliver R\u00fcbel", "hosted_by": "", "seminar_link": "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXSD3w-oqnLYnqhBcei-mAIX3WbZ26wwAFju1IP_5ClwiFpw/viewform", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "", "speaker_affil": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, CatalystNeuro, Allen Institute for Brain Science, and The Kavli Foundation", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_email": "", "speaker_website": "https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons/HCK08_2020_Remote/", "seminar_title": "8th NEURODATA Without Borders Workshop", "seminar_abstract": "The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology project (NWB, https://www.nwb.org/) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata.

To explore this hypothesis, we have developed two-photon holographic methods to selective image and manipulate the activity of neuronal populations in 3D in vivo (2). Using them we find that groups of synchronous neurons (neuronal ensembles) dominate the evoked and spontaneous activity of mouse primary visual cortex (3). Ensembles can be optogenetically imprinted for several days and some of their neurons trigger the entire ensemble (4). By activating these pattern completion cells in ensembles involved in visual discrimination paradigms, we can bi-directionally alter behavioral choices (5).

Abnormalities in bursts have also been associated with motor and psychiatric disorders. The determinants of burst generation are not known, specifically how single cell and connectivity parameters influence burst statistics and the corresponding brain states.  We first present a generic mathematical model for burst generation in an excitatory-inhibitory (EI) network with self-couplings. The resulting equations for the stochastic phase and envelope of the rhythm\u2019s fluctuations are shown to depend on only two meta-parameters that combine all the network parameters. They allow us to identify different regimes of amplitude excursions, and to highlight the supportive role that network finite-size effects and noisy inputs to the EI network can have. We discuss how burst attributes, such as their durations and peak frequency content, depend on the network parameters.  In practice, the problem above follows the a priori challenge of fitting such E-I spiking networks to single neuron or population data. Thus, the second part of the talk will discuss a novel method to fit mesoscale dynamics using single neuron data along with a low-dimensional, and hence statistically tractable, single neuron model. The mesoscopic representation is obtained by approximating a population of neurons as multiple homogeneous \u2018pools\u2019 of neurons, and modelling the dynamics of the aggregate population activity within each pool.

The time-dependent activation of the neural modes results in latent dynamics. We hypothesize that the latent dynamics associated with the consistent execution of a behavior need to remain stable, and use an alignment method to establish this stability.

Such normally adaptive behavioral state transitions can become maladaptive in disorders such as depression. We developed a new class of multi-region recurrent neural network (RNN) models to infer brain-wide interactions driving such maladaptive behavior. The models were trained to match experimental data across two levels simultaneously: brain-wide neural dynamics from 10-40,000 neurons and the realtime behavior of the fish. Analysis of the trained RNN models revealed a specific change in inter-area connectivity between the habenula (Hb) and raphe nucleus during the transition into passivity. We then characterized the multi-region neural dynamics underlying this transition. Using the interaction weights derived from the RNN models, we calculated the input currents from different brain regions to each Hb neuron. We then computed neural manifolds spanning these input currents across all Hb neurons to define subspaces within the Hb activity that captured communication with each other brain region independently. At the onset of stress, there was an immediate response within the Hb/raphe subspace alone. However, RNN models identified no early or fast-timescale change in the strengths of interactions between these regions. As the animal lapsed into passivity, the responses within the Hb/raphe subspace decreased, accompanied by a concomitant change in the interactions between the raphe and Hb inferred from the RNN weights. This innovative combination of network modeling and neural dynamics analysis points to dual mechanisms with distinct timescales driving the behavioral state transition: early response to stress is mediated by reshaping the neural dynamics within a preserved network architecture, while long-term state changes correspond to altered connectivity between neural ensembles in distinct brain regions.", "calendar_event_hash": "f70583d1e9f1bf4d73ba83c8caa966f31a6935b7d7b123511dbefead592381ea", "seminar_id": 40, "time_of_addition": "Wed, Mar 25, 2020 00:00"}, "41": {"seminar_date": "Wed, Jul 29, 2020", "seminar_time": "14:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "Dr", "seminar_speaker": "Nicolas Schuck", "hosted_by": "Oxford Neurotheory", "seminar_link": "https://zoom.us/j/438694496", "password": "1963", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "theory, cognitive", "speaker_affil": "MPI Berlin", "speaker_twitter": "@nico_schuck", "speaker_email": "schuck@mpib-berlin.mpg.de", "speaker_website": "https://schucklab.gitlab.io/", "seminar_title": "", "seminar_abstract": "", "calendar_event_hash": "bd58747aaea69b08b217a3579bd4595ceb91e9d1bbed69ff35b04181b45e8768", "seminar_id": 41, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Mar 30, 2020 19:00"}, "42": {"seminar_date": "Wed, Jul 8, 2020", "seminar_time": "14:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Linda Smith", "hosted_by": "Oxford Neurotheory", "seminar_link": "https://zoom.us/j/640704863", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "theory,devpsych", "speaker_affil": "Indiana University", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_email": "smith4@indiana.edu", "speaker_website": "https://cogdev.sitehost.iu.edu/", "seminar_title": "", "seminar_abstract": "", "calendar_event_hash": "4fb1a7b75531c038fa1e74ba76b8fa6bf32cfcc97d6b621becd8817844bffbbd", "seminar_id": 42, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Mar 30, 2020 19:00"}, "43": {"seminar_date": "Wed, Jun 10, 2020", "seminar_time": "12:00", "timezone": "America/New_York", "confirmed": "yes", "speaker_title": "Dr", "seminar_speaker": "Vanessa Ruta", "hosted_by": "Invertebrate Neuroecology", "seminar_link": "https://www.crowdcast.io/e/vanessa-ruta-world-wide", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "topic_tags": "invertebrate", "speaker_affil": "Rockefeller University", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_email": "", "speaker_website": "https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/989-vanessa-ruta/", "seminar_title": "Neural circuit mechanisms of behavioral evolution", "seminar_abstract": "Animals exhibit extraordinary variation in their behavior, yet little is known about the neural mechanisms that generate this diversity.

Drosophila olfaction presents an ideal model to study the biological basis of behavioral individuality, because while the neural circuit underlying olfactory behavior is well-described and highly stereotyped, persistent idiosyncrasy in behavior, neural coding, and neural wiring have also been described. Projection neurons (PNs), which relay odor signals sensed by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) to deeper brain structures, exhibit variable calcium responses to identical odor stimuli across individuals, but how these idiosyncrasies relate to individual behavioral responses remains unknown. Here, using paired behavior and two-photon imaging measurements, we show that idiosyncratic calcium dynamics in both ORNs and PNs predict individual preferences for an aversive monomolecular odorant versus air, suggesting that variation at the periphery of the olfactory system determines individual preference for an odor\u2019s presence. In contrast, PN, but not ORN, calcium responses predict individual preferences in a two-odor choice assay. Furthermore, paired behavior and immunohistochemistry measurements reveal that variation in ORN presynaptic density also predicts two-odor preference, suggesting this site is a locus of individuality where microscale circuit variation gives rise to idiosyncrasy in behavior.

We approach these questions using genetic tools, in vivo two-photon imaging, and patch-clamp electrophysiology in Drosophila. We recently found that the axons of fly leg proprioceptors are organized into distinct functional projections that contain topographic representations of specific kinematic features: one group of axons encodes tibia position, another encodes movement direction, and a third encodes bidirectional movement and vibration frequency. Whole-cell recordings from downstream neurons reveal that position, movement, and directional information remain segregated in central circuits.

We developed a high-throughput paradigm to study behavioral responses to temporally-controlled odor and wind stimuli.  Using this paradigm we found that flies respond to a food odor (apple cider vinegar) with two behaviors: during the odor they run upwind, while after odor loss they perform a local search.
