This multiplicative change is believed to be critical, since synaptic strengths are involved in learning and memory retention. Further, this homeostatic process is thought to be crucial for neuronal stability, playing a stabilizing role in otherwise runaway Hebbian plasticity [1-3]. Synaptic scaling requires a mechanism to sense total neuron activity and globally adjust synapses to achieve some activity set-point [4]. This process is relatively slow, which places limits on its ability to stabilize network activity [5]. Here we show that this slow response is inevitable in realistic neuronal morphologies. Furthermore, we reveal that global scaling can in fact be a source of instability unless responsiveness or scaling accuracy are sacrificed.\"  \"A neuron with tens of thousands of synapses must regulate its own excitability to compensate for changes in input. The time requirement for global feedback can introduce critical phase lags in a neuron\u2019s response to perturbation. The severity of phase lag increases with neuron size. Further, a more expansive morphology worsens cell responsiveness and scaling accuracy, especially in distal regions of the neuron. Local pools of reserve receptors improve efficiency, potentiation, and scaling, but this comes at a cost. Trafficking large quantities of receptors requires time, exacerbating the phase lag and instability. Local homeostatic feedback mitigates instability, but this too comes at the cost of reducing scaling accuracy.\"  \"Realization of the phase lag instability requires a unified model of synaptic scaling, regulation, and transport. We present such a model with global and local feedback in realistic neuron morphologies (Fig. 1). This combined model shows that neurons face a tradeoff between stability, accuracy, and efficiency. Global feedback is required for synaptic scaling but favors either system stability or efficiency. Large receptor pools improve scaling accuracy in large morphologies but worsen both stability and efficiency. Local feedback improves the stability-efficiency tradeoff at the cost of scaling accuracy.

Any decision that an organism or a subsystem of an organism takes involves the acquisition, selection, and processing of information and ultimately its concentration and enaction. It is the consequences of this balance that will occupy us in this talk. This perception-action loop picture of an agent's life cycle is well established and expounded especially in the context of Fuster's sensorimotor hierarchies. Nevertheless, the information-theoretic perspective drastically expands the potential and predictive power of the perception-action loop perspective. On the one hand information can be treated - to a significant extent - as a resource that is being sought and utilized by an organism. On the other hand, unlike energy, information is not additive. The intrinsic structure and dynamics of information can be exceedingly complex and subtle; in the last two decades one has discovered that Shannon information possesses a rich and nontrivial intrinsic structure that must be taken into account when informational contributions, information flow or causal interactions of processes are investigated, whether in the brain or in other complex processes. In addition, strong parallels between information and control theory have emerged. This parallelism between the theories allows one to obtain unexpected insights into the nature and properties of the perception-action loop. Through the lens of information theory, one can not only come up with novel hypotheses about necessary conditions for the organization of information processing in a brain, but also with constructive conjectures and predictions about what behaviours, brain structure and dynamics and even evolutionary pressures one can expect to operate on biological organisms, induced purely by informational considerations.", "hosted_by": "CNS 2020", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "65906f672224593aa431045d157ec1b72d36cdb4ed48510bd9e766af21f20e89", "seminar_id": 370, "time_of_addition": "Thu, Jul 16, 2020 15:55"}, "371": {"seminar_date": "Mon, Jul 20, 2020", "seminar_time": "16:20:00 PM", "timezone": "Europe/Berlin", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://ocns.memberclicks.net/assets/CNS_Meetings/CNS2020/CNS2020-Featured-talks.pdf", "password": "Please register at https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2020.

Comparison of the head direction circuit of two species", "seminar_abstract": "Ants, bees and other insects have the ability to return to their nest or hive using a navigation strategy known as path integration. Similarly, fruit flies employ path integration to return to a previously visited food source. An important component of path integration is the ability of the insect to keep track of its heading relative to salient visual cues. A highly conserved brain region known as the central complex has been identified as being of key importance for the computations required for an insect to keep track of its heading. However, the similarities or differences of the underlying heading tracking circuit between species are not well understood. We sought to address this shortcoming by using reverse engineering techniques to derive the effective underlying neural circuits of two evolutionary distant species, the fruit fly and the locust. Our analysis revealed that regardless of the anatomical differences between the two species the essential circuit structure has not changed. Both effective neural circuits have the structural topology of a ring attractor with an eight-fold radial symmetry (Fig. 1). However, despite the strong similarities between the two ring attractors, there remain differences. Using computational modelling we found that two apparently small anatomical differences have significant functional effect on the ability of the two circuits to track fast rotational movements and to maintain a stable heading signal. In particular, the fruit fly circuit responds faster to abrupt heading changes of the animal while the locust circuit maintains a heading signal that is more robust to inhomogeneities in cell membrane properties and synaptic weights. We suggest that the effects of these differences are consistent with the behavioural ecology of the two species. On the one hand, the faster response of the ring attractor circuit in the fruit fly accommodates the fast body saccades that fruit flies are known to perform. On the other hand, the locust is a migratory species, so its behaviour demands maintenance of a defined heading for a long period of time. Our results highlight that even seemingly small differences in the distribution of dendritic fibres can have a significant effect on the dynamics of the effective ring attractor circuit with consequences for the behavioural capabilities of each species. These differences, emerging from morphologically distinct single neurons highlight the importance of a comparative approach to neuroscience.", "hosted_by": "CNS 2020", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "662fd6dba1ba52efae2f3d7428bef001708e8e65837f1383f6efbc0d7c2810cd", "seminar_id": 371, "time_of_addition": "Thu, Jul 16, 2020 15:55"}, "372": {"seminar_date": "Tue, Jul 21, 2020", "seminar_time": "7:00", "timezone": "Europe/Berlin", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://ocns.memberclicks.net/assets/CNS_Meetings/CNS2020/CNS2020-Keynotes.pdf", "password": "Please register at https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2020.

Using a combination of immunohistochemistry and computational analysis we have examined pathway differences between vulnerable and resistant neurons.

To elucidate such mechanisms in human cells, we established a CRISPR-based platform for genetic screening in human iPSC-derived neurons, astrocytes and microglia. Our approach relies on CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa), in which a catalytically dead version of the bacterial Cas9 protein recruits transcriptional repressors or activators, respectively, to endogenous genes to control their expression, as directed by a small guide RNA (sgRNA). Complex libraries of sgRNAs enable us to conduct genome-wide or focused loss-of-function and gain-of-function screens. Such screens uncover molecular players for phenotypes based on survival, stress resistance, fluorescent phenotypes, high-content imaging and single-cell RNA-Seq. To uncover disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets, we are conducting genetic modifier screens for disease-relevant cellular phenotypes in patient-derived neurons and glia with familial mutations and isogenic controls. In a genome-wide screen, we have uncovered genes that modulate the formation of disease-associated aggregates of tau in neurons with a tauopathy-linked mutation (MAPT V337M).

Paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic drug, for example is associated with high incidence of peripheral neuropathy, around 71% of the patients of which 27% of these develop neuropathic pain. Use of cannabis or phytocannabinoids has been reported to improve pain measures in patients with neuropathic pain, including painful HIV-associated sensory neuropathy and cancer pain. Phytocannabinoids and endocannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), produce their effects via cannabinoid (CB) receptors, which are present both in the periphery and central nervous system. Endocannabinoids are synthesized in an \u201con demand\u201d fashion and are degraded by various enzymes such as fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL). Various studies, including those from our group, suggest that there are changes in gene and protein expression of endocannabinoid molecules during chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CINP), HIV and antiretroviral-induced neuropathic pain. Analysis of endocannabinoid molecule expression in the brain, spinal cord and paw skin using LC-MS/MS show that there is a specific deficiency of the endocannabinoids 2-AG and/or anandamide in the periphery during CINP. Various drugs including endocannabinoids, cannabidiol, inhibitors of FAAH and MGL, CB receptor agonists, desipramine and coadministered indomethacin plus minocycline have been found to either prevent the development and/or attenuate established CINP, HIV and antiretroviral-induced neuropathic pain in a CB receptor-dependent manner.

PD is characterized by four cardinal motor symptoms: bradykinesia / akinesia, rigidity, postural instability and tremors at rest. These symptoms appear when 80% of the dopaminergic endings disappear in the striatum. According to Braak's theory, non-motor symptoms appear much earlier and this is particularly the case with anxiety, depression, anhedonia, and sleep disturbances. In 90 to 95% of cases, the causes of the appearance of the disease remain unknown, but polluting toxic molecules are incriminated more and more.

The focus of this talk is on understanding the role of the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic circuit, and especially the prefrontal cortex, in higher-order executive dysfunction (e.g., disadvantageous decision-making such as trading a car for a couple of cocaine hits) in drug addicted individuals. The theoretical model that guides the presented research is called iRISA (Impaired Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution), postulating that abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, as related to dopaminergic dysfunction, contribute to the core clinical symptoms in drug addiction. Specifically, our multi-modality program of research is guided by the underlying working hypothesis that drug addicted individuals disproportionately attribute reward value to their drug of choice at the expense of other potentially but no-longer-rewarding stimuli, with a concomitant decrease in the ability to inhibit maladaptive drug use.

The molecular pathophysiology of glioblastoma cells and surrounding neurons and untransformed astrocytes are compared at serial stages of tumor development. Initial studies reveal that epileptiform EEG spiking is a very early and reliable preclinical signature of GBM expansion in these mice, followed by rapidly progressive seizures and death within weeks. FACS-sorted transcriptomic analysis of cortical astrocytes reveals the expansion of a subgroup enriched in pro-synaptogenic genes that may drive hyperexcitability, a novel mechanism of epileptogenesis.

However, new work from our lab has revealed more complex dynamics. The impulses fire sparsely and interact with brain rhythms of different frequencies. Higher frequency gamma (> 35 Hz) rhythms help carry the contents of working memory while lower frequency alpha/beta (~8-30 Hz) rhythms act as control signals that gate access to and clear out working memory.

TRN dysfunction has been linked to sensory abnormality, attention deficit and sleep disturbance across multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. Currently, little is known about the organizational principles underlying its divergent functions. In this talk, I will start with an example of how dysfunction of TRN contributes to attention deficit and sleep disruption using a mouse model of Ptchd1 mutation, which in humans cause neurodevelopmental disorder with ASD. Building on these findings, we further performed an integrative single-cell analysis linking molecular and electrophysiological features of the TRN to connectivity and systems-level function. We identified two subnetworks of the TRN with segregated anatomical structure, distinct electrophysiological properties, differential connections to the functionally distinct first-order and higher-order thalamic nuclei, and differential role in regulating sleep. These studies provide a comprehensive atlas for TRN neurons at the single-cell resolution and a foundation for studying diverse functions and dysfunctions of the TRN.

Nearly all brain functions are influenced by past events, reinforcing the view that the confluence of plasticity and computation in the same circuit elements is a core component of biological intelligence. My laboratory studies plasticity in the cerebral cortex during development, and plasticity during behaviour that is manifest as cortical dynamics. I will describe how cortical plasticity is implemented by learning rules that involve not only Hebbian changes and synaptic scaling but also dendritic renormalization. By using advanced techniques such as optical measurements of single-synapse function and structure in identified neurons in awake behaving mice, we have recently demonstrated locally coordinated plasticity in dendrites whereby specific synapses are strengthened and adjacent synapses with complementary features are weakened. Together, these changes cooperatively implement functional plasticity in neurons. Such plasticity relies on the dynamics of activity-dependent molecules within and between synapses. Alongside, it is increasingly clear that risk genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders disproportionately target molecules of plasticity. Deficits in renormalization contribute fundamentally to dysfunctional neuronal circuits and computations, and may be a unifying mechanistic feature of these disorders.", "hosted_by": "MIT Brain & Cog Sci", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "402f34b741a5c784aec8575c17435f942e3439da236c611fe25e224804d9312d", "seminar_id": 868, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Sep 28, 2020 11:07"}, "869": {"seminar_date": "Thu, May 28, 2020", "seminar_time": "16:00", "timezone": "America/New_York", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://mit.zoom.us/j/92346493144", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Nancy Kanwisher", "speaker_affil": "MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_website": "https://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/index.shtml", "topic_tags": "cognition, systems, neural networks, recognition", "seminar_title": "Domain Specificity in the Human Brain: What, Whether, and Why?", "seminar_abstract": "The last quarter century has provided extensive  evidence that some regions of the human cortex are selectively engaged in processing a single specific domain of information, from faces, places, and bodies to language, music, and other people\u2019s thoughts. This work dovetails with earlier theories in cognitive science highlighting domain specificity in human cognition, development, and evolution. But many questions remain unanswered about even the clearest cases of domain specificity in the brain, the selective engagement of the FFA, PPA, and EBA in the perception of faces, places, and bodies, respectively. First, these claims lack precision, saying little about what is computed and how, and relying on human judgements to decide what counts as a face, place, or body. Second, they provide no account of the reliably varying responses of these regions across different \u201cpreferred\u201d images, or across different \u201cnonpreferred\u201d images for each category. Third, the category selectivity of each region is vulnerable to refutation if any of the vast set of as-yet-untested nonpreferred images turns out to produce a stronger response than preferred images for that region. Fourth, and most fundamentally, they provide no account of why, from a computational point of view, brains should exhibit this striking degree of functional specificity in the first place, and why we should have the particular visual specializations we do, for faces, places, and bodies, but not (apparently) for food or snakes.

Recent advances in optogenetic techniques and mouse genetics now offer ways to specifically probe the functional properties of neural circuits with unprecedented specificity. Perhaps one of the most heavily interrogated circuits in the mouse brain is one in the retina that is involved in coding direction (reviewed by Mauss et al., 2017; Vaney et al., 2012). In this circuit, direction is encoded by specialized direction-selective (DS) ganglion cells (DSGCs), which respond robustly to objects moving in a \u2018preferred\u2019 direction but not in the opposite or \u2018null\u2019 direction (Barlow and Levick, 1965). We now know this computation relies on the coordination of three transmitter systems: glutamate, GABA and acetylcholine (ACh). In this talk, I will discuss the synaptic mechanisms that produce the spatiotemporal patterns of inhibition and excitation that are crucial for shaping directional selectivity. Special emphasis will be placed on the role of ACh, as it is unclear whether it is mediated by synaptic or non-synaptic mechanisms, which is in fact a central issue in the CNS.\nBarlow, H.B., and Levick, W.R.

In general, visual perception scales with changes in the visual stimulus, or contrast, irrespective of background illumination. This is achieved by adaptation. However, visual perception is challenged when adaptation is not fast enough to deal with sudden changes in overall illumination, for example when gaze follows a moving object from bright sunlight into a shaded area. We have recently shown that the visual system of the fly found a solution by propagating a corrective luminance-sensitive signal to higher processing stages. Using in vivo two-photon imaging and behavioural analyses we showed that distinct OFF-pathway inputs encode contrast and luminance. The luminance-sensitive pathway is particularly required when processing visual motion in contextual dim light, when pure contrast sensitivity underestimates the salience of a stimulus. \nRecent work in the lab has addressed the question how two visual pathways obtain such fundamentally different sensitivities, given common photoreceptor input. We are furthermore currently working out the network-based strategies by which luminance- and contrast-sensitive signals are combined to guide appropriate visual behaviour.

This allows following the complete visual signal across consecutive processing stages in a systematic way.\nIn my talk, I will summarize our recent findings on the functional diversity of retinal output channels and how they arise within the retinal network. Specifically, I will talk about the role of inhibition and cell-type specific dendritic processing in generating diverse visual channels. Then, I will focus on how color \u2013 a single visual feature \u2013 emerges across all retinal processing layers and link our results to behavioral output and the statistics of mouse natural scenes.

Adaptations to the statistics of the natural environment can be observed along the early visual pathway and across species. Therefore, characterising the properties of natural environments and studying the representation of natural scenes along the visual pathway is crucial for advancing our understanding of the structure and function of the visual system. In the past 20 years, mice have become an important model in vision research, but the fact that they live in a different environment than primates and have different visual needs is rarely considered. One particular challenge for characterising the mouse\u2019s visual environment is that they are dichromats with photoreceptors that detect UV light, which the typical camera does not record. This also has consequences for experimental visual stimulation, as the blue channel of computer screens fails to excite mouse UV cone photoreceptors.

Infants are able to estimate and calculate even before they learn the words for numbers. How have we come to possess this talent for numbers? In A Brain for Numbers, Andreas Nieder explains how our brains process numbers. He reports that numerical competency is deeply rooted in our biological ancestry; it can be traced through both the evolution of our species and the development of our individual minds. It is not, as it has been traditionally explained, based on our ability to use language. We owe our symbolic mathematical skills to the nonsymbolic numerical abilities that we inherited from our ancestors. The principles of mathematics, Nieder tells us, are reflections of the innate dispositions wired into the brain.", "hosted_by": "NeuroBehaviour in Quarantine Times", "domain": ["Neuroscience"],

There is not necessarily \u2018something it is like\u2019 to see. (2) Affective feeling, by contrast, is conscious by definition. You cannot feel something without feeling it. Moreover, affective feeling, generated in the upper brainstem, is the foundational form of consciousness: prerequisite for all the higher cognitive forms. (3) The functional mechanism of feeling explains why and how it cannot go on \u2018in the dark\u2019, free of any inner feel. Affect enables the organism to monitor deviations from its expected self-states in uncertain situations and thereby frees homeostasis from the limitations of automatism.

Three cases of visual mirror-reversal have been reported: AH (McCloskey, 2009), TM (McCloskey, Valtonen, & Sherman, 2006) and PR (Pflugshaupt et al., 2007). This research reports a fourth case, BS -- with focal occipital cortical dysgenesis -- who displays highly unusual visuospatial abnormalities. They initially produced mirror reversal errors similar to those of AH, who -- like the patient in question -- showed a selective developmental deficit. Extensive examination of BS revealed phenomena such as: mirror reversal errors (sometimes affecting only parts of the visual fields) in both horizontal and vertical planes; subjective representation of visual objects and words in distinct left and right visual fields; subjective duplication of objects of visual attention (not due to diplopia); uncertainty regarding the canonical upright orientation of everyday objects; mirror reversals during saccadic eye movements on oculomotor tasks; and failure to integrate visual with other sensory inputs (e.g., they feel themself moving backwards when visual information shows they are moving forward). Fewer errors are produced under conditions of certain visual variables. These and other findings have led the researchers to conclude that BS draws upon a subjective representation of visual space that is structured phenomenally much as it is anatomically in early visual cortex (i.e., rotated through 180 degrees, split into left and right fields, etc.).

For large neuronal populations, the gap between the spiking neuron dynamics on the microscopic level and coarse-grained FR models on the population level can be bridged by mean-field theory formally valid for infinitely many neurons. It remains however challenging to extend the resulting mean-field models to finite-size populations with biologically realistic neuron numbers per cell type (mesoscopic scale). In this talk, I present a mathematical framework for mesoscopic populations of generalized integrate-and-fire neuron models that accounts for fluctuations caused by the finite number of neurons. To this end, I will introduce the refractory density method for quasi-renewal processes and show how this method can be generalized to finite-size populations. To demonstrate the flexibility of this approach, I will show how synaptic short-term plasticity can be incorporated in the mesoscopic mean-field framework.

Through the work of Curtis Bell and others, a model was previously developed to describe the output stage of the ELL, but the role of the Purkinje-cell analogs, the medium ganglion (MG) cells, in the circuit had remained mysterious. I will present a complete, multi-layer circuit description of the ELL, developed in collaboration with Nate Sawtell and Salomon Muller, that reveals a novel role for the MG cells.

In the wild, rodents combine odor information with an internal spatial representation of the environment for foraging and navigation. What are the neural circuits in the brain that implement these behaviours? My research addresses this question by examining the synaptic circuits and neural population activity in the olfactory cortex to understand the integration of olfactory and spatial information. Primary olfactory (piriform) cortex (PCx) has long been recognized as a highly associative brain structure. What is the behavioural and functional role of these associative synapses in PCx? We designed an odor-cued navigation task, where rats must use both olfactory and spatial information to obtain water rewards. We recorded from populations of posterior piriform cortex (pPCx) neurons during behaviour and found that individual neurons were not only odor-selective, but also fired differentially to the same odor sampled at different locations, forming an \u201colfactory place map\u201d. Spatial locations can be decoded from simultaneously recorded pPCx population, and spatial selectivity is maintained in the absence of odors, across behavioural contexts. This novel olfactory place map is consistent with our finding for a dominant role of associative excitatory synapses in shaping PCx representations, and suggest a role for PCx spatial representations in supporting olfactory navigation. This work not only provides insight into the neural basis for how odors can be used for navigation, but also reveals PCx as a prime site for addressing the general question of how sensory information is anchored within memory systems and combined with cognitive maps to guide flexible behaviour.", "hosted_by": "U Oregon Neuro", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "e9f5630d4ffcc34bb41523b0f3bd9575c4c487ee4179ec8e8e7628dec017cbb1", "seminar_id": 849, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Sep 28, 2020 11:07"}, "850": {"seminar_date": "Tue, May 19, 2020", "seminar_time": "16:00", "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://uoregon.zoom.us/j/92792174660?pwd=WGkvVjZtcVV1K3pOS0Rpd1ZhZHkxZz09", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "speaker_title": "Dr", "seminar_speaker": "Laureline Logiaco", "speaker_affil": "Columbia University", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_website": "", "topic_tags": "theory", "seminar_title": "Flexible motor sequencing through thalamic control of cortical dynamics", "seminar_abstract": "The mechanisms by which neural circuits generate an extensible library of motor motifs and flexibly string them into arbitrary sequences are unclear. We developed a model in which inhibitory basal ganglia output neurons project to thalamic units that are themselves bidirectionally connected to a recurrent cortical network. During movement sequences, electrophysiological recordings of basal ganglia output neurons show sustained activity patterns that switch at the boundaries between motifs. Thus, we model these inhibitory patterns as silencing some thalamic neurons while leaving others disinhibited and free to interact with cortex during specific motifs. We show that a small number of disinhibited thalamic neurons can control cortical dynamics to generate specific motor output in a noise robust way.

Prior theoretical work in understanding the properties of RNNs has focused on models with additive interactions. However, real neurons can have gating i.e. multiplicative interactions, and gating is also a central feature of the best performing RNNs in machine learning. Here, we develop a dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to study the consequences of gating in RNNs. We use random matrix theory to show how gating robustly produces marginal stability and line attractors \u2013 important mechanisms for biologically-relevant computations requiring long memory. The long-time behavior of the gated network is studied using its Lyapunov spectrum, and the DMFT is used to provide a novel analytical expression for the maximum Lyapunov exponent demonstrating its close relation to relaxation-time of the dynamics. Gating is also shown to give rise to a novel, discontinuous transition to chaos, where the proliferation of critical points (topological complexity) is decoupled from the appearance of chaotic dynamics (dynamical complexity), contrary to a seminal result for additive RNNs. Critical surfaces and regions of marginal stability in the parameter space are indicated in phase diagrams, thus providing a map for principled parameter choices for ML practitioners. Finally, we develop a field-theory for gradients that arise in training, by incorporating the adjoint sensitivity framework from control theory in the DMFT.

In this talk, I will then discuss the method, its advantages and limitations, and some of the key discoveries regarding coding of tactile events in the signalling from receptors in the human skin. An extension of the method is to stimulate single afferents, and record the resulting tactile sensations reported by the participants, so-called microstimulation. The first experiments were done in the 1980s, but the method has recently seen a revival, and is currently being combined with high-resolution brain imaging in the study of the relationship between tactile nerve signals, sensations, and processing of tactile information in the brain.", "e-mail": "", "Email Address": "neutouchboard@gmail.com", "timezone": "Europe/Amsterdam", "password": "",

neuronal development is critical to establish neural circuits and a nervous system1. Every presynapse builds a core active zone structure where ion channels are clustered and synaptic vesicles are released2. While the composition of active zones is well characterized2,3, how active zone proteins assemble together and recruit synaptic release machinery during development is not clear. Here, we find core active zone scaffold proteins SYD-2/Liprin-\u03b1 and ELKS-1 phase separate during an early stage of synapse development, and later mature into a solid structure. We directly test the in vivo function of phase separation with mutants specifically lacking this activity. These mutant SYD-2 and ELKS-1 proteins remain enriched at synapses, but are defective in active zone assembly and synapse function. The defects are rescued with the introduction of a phase separation motif from an unrelated protein. In vitro, we reconstitute the SYD-2 and ELKS-1 liquid phase scaffold and find it is competent to bind and incorporate downstream active zone components.

Genetic sleep induction methods in animal models provide a powerful way to disambiguate these stages and functions, although behavioural methods alone are insufficient to accurately identify what kind of sleep is being engaged. In Drosophila, activation of the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) promotes sleep, but it remains unclear what kind of sleep this is, how the rest of the fly brain is behaving, or if any specific sleep functions are being achieved. Here, we developed a method to record calcium activity from thousands of neurons across a volume of the fly brain during dFB-induced sleep, and we compared this to the effects of a sleep-promoting drug. We found that drug-induced spontaneous sleep decreased brain activity and connectivity, whereas dFB sleep was not different from wakefulness. Paradoxically, dFB-induced sleep was found to be even deeper than drug- induced sleep. When we probed the sleeping fly brain with salient visual stimuli, we found that the activity of visually-responsive neurons was blocked by dFB activation, confirming a disconnect from the external environment. Prolonged optogenetic dFB activation nevertheless achieved a significant sleep function, by correcting visual attention defects brought on by sleep deprivation. These results suggest that dFB activation promotes a distinct form of sleep in Drosophila, where brain activity and connectivity remain similar to wakefulness, but responsiveness to external sensory stimuli is profoundly suppressed.", "hosted_by": "Cortex Club", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "251c341b64ba76c5ef850dcc395aef9db5f39f7a207956f668c941755c4700b9", "seminar_id": 320, "time_of_addition": "Fri, Jul 03, 2020 14:00"}, "897": {"seminar_date": "Thu, May 21, 2020", "seminar_time": "16:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://cortexclub.com/join-us/", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "speaker_title": "Dr", "seminar_speaker": "Lorenz Fenk", "speaker_affil": "Max Planck Institute for Brain Research", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_website": "", "topic_tags": "claustrum, sleep", "seminar_title": "Dragons, Sleep, and the Claustrum", "seminar_abstract": "The mammalian claustrum, by virtue of its dense interconnectivity with cortex and other brain structures, has been hypothesized to mediate functions ranging from decision making to consciousness.

In fact, cortical taste responses, rather than simply reporting individual taste identities, do contain characterizable dynamics: taste-driven firing first reflects the substance\u2019s presence on the tongue, and then broadly codes taste quality, and then shifts again to correlate with the taste\u2019s current palatability\u2014the basis of consumption decisions\u2014all across the 1-1.5 seconds after taste administration.

Despite their complexity, listeners can readily tease apart relevant changes from irrelevant variations. This requires continuously tracking the appropriate sensory evidence while discarding noisy acoustic variations. Despite the apparent simplicity of this perceptual phenomenon, the neural basis of the extraction of relevant information in complex continuous streams for goal-directed behavior is currently not well understood. As a minimalistic model for change detection in complex auditory environments, we designed broad-range tone clouds whose first-order statistics change at a random time. Subjects (humans or ferrets) were trained to detect these changes.They were faced with the dual-task of estimating the baseline statistics and detecting a potential change in those statistics at any moment. To characterize the extraction and encoding of relevant sensory information along the cortical hierarchy, we first recorded the brain electrical activity of human subjects engaged in this task using electroencephalography. Human performance and reaction times improved with longer pre-change exposure, consistent with improved estimation of baseline statistics. Change-locked and decision-related EEG responses were found in a centro-parietal scalp location, whose slope depended on change size, consistent with sensory evidence accumulation. To further this investigation, we performed a series of electrophysiological recordings in the primary auditory cortex (A1), secondary auditory cortex (PEG) and frontal cortex (FC) of the fully trained behaving ferret. A1 neurons exhibited strong onset responses and change-related discharges specific to neuronal tuning. PEG population showed reduced onset-related responses, but more categorical change-related modulations. Finally, a subset of FC neurons (dlPFC/premotor) presented a generalized response to all change-related events only during behavior. We show using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that the same subpopulation in FC encodes sensory and decision signals, suggesting that FC neurons could operate conversion of sensory evidence to perceptual decision. All together, these area-specific responses suggest a behavior-dependent mechanism of sensory extraction and generalization of task-relevant event.

Using the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system, we study the influence of these differences in underlying structure on differential resilience of individuals to a variety of environmental perturbations, including changes in temperature, pH, potassium concentration and neuromodulation. We show that neurons with many different kinds of ion channels can smoothly move through different mechanisms in generating their activity patterns, thus extending their dynamic range.

First, we have developed a method for imaging specimens with nanoscale precision, by embedding them in a swellable polymer, homogenizing their mechanical properties, and exposing them to water \u2013 which causes them to expand manyfold isotropically. This method, which we call expansion microscopy (ExM), enables ordinary microscopes to do nanoscale imaging, in a multiplexed fashion \u2013 important, for example, for brain mapping. Second, we have developed a set of genetically-encoded reagents, known as optogenetic tools, that when expressed in specific neurons, enable their electrical activities to be precisely driven or silenced in response to millisecond timescale pulses of light. Finally, we are designing, and evolving, novel reagents, such as fluorescent voltage indicators and somatically targeted calcium indicators, to enable the imaging of fast physiological processes in 3-D with millisecond precision. In this way we aim to enable the systematic mapping, control, and dynamical observation of complex biological systems like the brain.

Para permitir la comprensi\u00f3n y reparaci\u00f3n de sistemas biol\u00f3gicos complejos, como el cerebro, estamos creando herramientas \u00f3pticas novedosas que permiten crear mapas de resoluci\u00f3n molecular de dichos sistemas, as\u00ed como tecnolog\u00edas para observar y controlar la din\u00e1mica fisiol\u00f3gica de alta velocidad en dichos sistemas. Primero, hemos desarrollado un m\u00e9todo para obtener im\u00e1genes de muestras con precisi\u00f3n a nanoescala, incrust\u00e1ndolas en un pol\u00edmero hinchable, homogeneizando sus propiedades mec\u00e1nicas y exponi\u00e9ndolas al agua, lo que hace que se expandan muchas veces isotr\u00f3picamente. Este m\u00e9todo, que llamamos microscop\u00eda de expansi\u00f3n (ExM), permite que los microscopios ordinarios obtengan im\u00e1genes a nanoescala, de forma multiplexada, lo que es importante, por ejemplo, para el mapeo cerebral. En segundo lugar, hemos desarrollado un conjunto de reactivos codificados gen\u00e9ticamente, conocidos como herramientas optogen\u00e9ticas, que cuando se expresan en neuronas espec\u00edficas, permiten que sus actividades el\u00e9ctricas sean activadas o silenciadas con precisi\u00f3n en respuesta a pulsos de luz en una escala de tiempo de milisegundos. Finalmente, estamos dise\u00f1ando y desarrollando reactivos novedosos, como indicadores de voltaje fluorescentes e indicadores de calcio dirigidos som\u00e1ticamente, para permitir la obtenci\u00f3n de im\u00e1genes de procesos fisiol\u00f3gicos r\u00e1pidos en 3-D con precisi\u00f3n de milisegundos. De esta manera, nuestro objetivo es permitir el mapeo sistem\u00e1tico, el control y la observaci\u00f3n din\u00e1mica de sistemas biol\u00f3gicos complejos como el cerebro.

A growing body of evidence shows that carnosine is involved in many cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress, including inhibition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregation, modulation of nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, and scavenging both reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Different types of cells are involved in the innate immune response, with macrophage cells representing those primarily activated, especially under different diseases characterized by oxidative stress and systemic inflammation such as depression and cardiovascular disorders. Microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages of the brain, are emerging as a central player in regulating key pathways in central nervous system inflammation; with specific regard to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) these cells exert a dual role: on one hand promoting the clearance of A\u03b2 via phagocytosis, on the other hand increasing neuroinflammation through the secretion of inflammatory mediators and free radicals.\nThe activity of carnosine was tested in an in vitro model of macrophage activation (M1) (RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS + IFN-\u03b3) and in a well-validated model of A\u03b2-induced neuroinflammation (BV-2 microglia treated with A\u03b2 oligomers). An ample set of techniques/assays including MTT assay, trypan\nblue exclusion test, high performance liquid chromatography, high-throughput real-time PCR, western blot, atomic force microscopy, microchip electrophoresis coupled to laser-induced fluorescence, and ELISA aimed to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of carnosine was employed.\nIn our experimental model of macrophage activation (M1), therapeutic concentrations of carnosine exerted the following effects: 1) an increased degradation rate of NO into its non-toxic end-products nitrite and nitrate; 2) the amelioration of the macrophage energy state, by restoring nucleoside triphosphates and counterbalancing the changes in ATP/ADP, NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH ratio obtained by LPS + IFN-\u03b3 induction; 3) a reduced expression of pro-oxidant enzymes (NADPH oxidase, Cyclooxygenase-2) and of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde; 4) the rescue of antioxidant enzymes expression (Glutathione peroxidase 1, Superoxide dismutase 2, Catalase); 5) an increased synthesis of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) combined with the negative modulation of interleukines 1\u03b2 and 6 (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6), and 6) the induction of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1).\nIn our experimental model of A\u03b2-induced neuroinflammation, carnosine: 1) prevented cell death in BV-2 cells challenged with A\u03b2 oligomers; 2) lowered oxidative stress by decreasing the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and NADPH oxidase, and the concentrations of nitric oxide and superoxide anion; 3) decreased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 simultaneously rescuing IL-10 levels and increasing the expression and the release of TGF-\u03b21; 4) prevented A\u03b2-induced neurodegeneration in primary mixed neuronal cultures challenged with A\u03b2 oligomers and these neuroprotective effects was completely abolished by SB431542, a selective inhibitor of type-1 TGF-\u03b2 receptor.\nOverall, our data suggest a novel multimodal mechanism of action of carnosine underlying its protective effects in macrophages and microglia and the therapeutic potential of this dipeptide in counteracting pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory phenomena observed in different disorders characterized by elevated levels of oxidative stress and inflammation such as depression, cardiovascular disorders, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.", "hosted_by": "NeuroLeman Network", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "ab0eb0a52455e2ab769c4e3fc1bdff196d452308a3d92befcf5a7061d6f89f5a", "seminar_id": 938, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Sep 28, 2020 13:05"}, "939": {"seminar_date": "Thu, Oct 1, 2020", "seminar_time": "12:15", "timezone": "Europe/Zurich", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://unil.zoom.us/j/2636884125", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Bart De Strooper", "speaker_affil": "\"UK Dementia Research Institute, UCL, London &\nKU Leuven & VIB Center for Brain and Disease Research, Belgium\"", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_website": "", "topic_tags": "Alzheimer's, microglia, stem cells", "seminar_title": "The cellular phase of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease:\nfrom genes to cells", "seminar_abstract": "The amyloid cascade hypothesis for Alzheimer disease  ((Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Hardy and Higgins, 1992; Selkoe, 1991), updated in (Karran et al., 2011) provides a linear model for the pathogenesis of AD with A\u03b2 accumulation upstream and Tau pathology, inflammation, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss and dementia downstream,  all interlinked, initiated and driven by A\u03b242 peptides or oligomers. The genetic mutations causing familial Alzheimer disease seem to support this model. The nagging problem remains however that the postulated causal, and especially the \u2019driving\u2019 role of abnormal A\u03b2 aggregation or A\u03b2 oligomer formation could not be convincingly demonstrated until now. Indeed, many questions (e.g. what causes A\u03b2 toxicity, what is the relation between A\u03b2 and Tau pathology, what causes neuronal death, why is amyloid deposition not correlated with dementia etc\u2026) were already raised when the amyloid hypothesis was conceived 25 years ago. These questions remain in essence unanswered. It seems that the old paradigm is not tenable: the amyloid cascade is too linear, too neurocentric, and does not take into account the long time lag between the biochemical phase i.e. the appearance of amyloid plaques and neuronal tangles and the ultimate clinical phase, i.e. the manifestation of dementia. The pathways linking these two phases must be complex and tortuous. We have called this the cellular phase of AD (De Strooper and Karran, 2016) to suggest that a long period of action and reaction involving neurons, neuronal circuitry but also microglia, astroglia, oligodendrocytes, and the vasculature underlies the disease. In fact it is this long disease process that should be studied in the coming years. While microglia are part of this process, they should not be considered as the only component of the cellular phase. We expect that further clinical investigations and novel tools will allow to diagnose the effects of the cellular changes in the brain and provide clinical signs for this so called preclinical or prodromal AD. Furthermore the better understanding of this phase will lead to completely novel drug targets and treatments and will lead to an era where patients will receive an appropriate therapy according to their clinical stage. In this view anti-amyloid therapy is probably only effective and useful in the very early stage of the disease and AD does no longer equal to dementia.  We will discuss in our talk how single cell technology and transplantation of human iPS cells into mouse brain allow to start to map in a systematic way the cellular phase of Alzheimer\u2019s

We charted vagal sensory neurons by single cell RNA sequencing, identifying novel cell surface receptors and classifying a staggering diversity of sensory neuron types. We then generated a collection of ires-Cre knock-in mice to target each neuron type, and adapted genetic tools for Cre-based anatomical mapping, in vivo imaging, targeted ablation, and optogenetic control of vagal neuron activity.

In animals fed high sugar, the binding of PRC2.1 to the chromatin of the sweet gustatory neurons is redistributed to repress a developmental transcriptional network that modulates the responsiveness of these cells to sweet stimuli, reducing sweet sensation.

Neurons are very sensitive to changes in the extracellular fluid surrounding them, which necessitated shielding of the nervous system from fluctuating solute concentrations in circulation. This is achieved by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that prevents paracellular diffusion of solutes into the nervous system. This in turn also means that all nutrients that are needed e.g. for sufficient energy supply need to be transported over the BBB. We use Drosophila as a model system to better understand the metabolic homeostasis in the central nervous system.\nGlial cells play essential roles in both nutrient uptake and neural energy metabolism. Carbohydrate transport over the glial BBB is well-regulated and can be adapted to changes in carbohydrate availability. Furthermore, Drosophila glial cell are highly glycolytic cells that support the rather oxidative metabolism of neurons. Upon perturbations of carbohydrate metabolism, the glial cells prove to be metabolically very flexible and able to adapt to changing circumstances. I will summarize what we know about carbohydrate transport at the Drosophila BBB and about the metabolic coupling between neurons and glial cells.

Despite the robust influence on brain function, T cells are not found within the brain parenchyma, a fact that only adds more mystery into these enigmatic interactions between T cells and the brain. Our results suggest that meningeal space, surrounding the brain, is the site where CNS-associated immune activity takes place. We have recently discovered a presence of meningeal lymphatic vessels that drain CNS molecules and immune cells to the deep cervical lymph nodes. This communication between the CNS and the peripheral immunity is playing a key role in neurophysiology and in several CNS disorders. Interestingly, meningeal lymphatics are impaired in aging and their dysfunction may be related to age-related cognitive decline as well as to Alzheimer\u2019s pathology.

This work has the potential to fundamentally reshape understanding of the evolution of insect flight, as well as highlight the tremendous importance of timing in the context of locomotion. Timing is crucial to the nervous system. The ability to rapidly detect and process subtle disturbances in the environment determines whether an animal can attain its next meal or successfully navigate complex, unpredictable terrain. While previous work on various animals has made tremendous strides uncovering the specialized neural circuits used to resolve timing differences with sub-microsecond resolution, it has focused on the detection of timing differences in sensory systems. Understanding of how the timing of motor output is structured by precise sensory input remains poor. My research focuses on an organ unique to fruit flies, called the haltere, that serves as a bridge for detecting and acting on subtle timing differences, helping flies execute rapid maneuvers.

We first found that PL occurs for task-irrelevant and subthreshold features and that pairing task-irrelevant features with rewards is the key to form task-irrelevant PL (TIPL) (Watanabe, Nanez & Sasaki, Nature, 2001; Watanabe et al, 2002, Nature Neuroscience; Seitz & Watanabe, Nature, 2003; Seitz, Kim & Watanabe, 2009, Neuron; Shibata et al, 2011, Science). These results suggest that PL occurs as a result of interactions between reinforcement and bottom-up stimulus signals (Seitz & Watanabe, 2005, TICS). On the other hand, fMRI study results indicate that lateral prefrontal cortex fails to detect and thus to suppress subthreshold task-irrelevant signals. This leads to the paradoxical effect that a signal that is below, but close to, one\u2019s discrimination threshold ends up being stronger than suprathreshold signals (Tsushima, Sasaki & Watanabe, 2006, Science). We confirmed this mechanism with the following results: Task-irrelevant learning occurs only when a presented feature is under and close to the threshold with younger individuals (Tsushima et al, 2009, Current Biol), whereas with older individuals who tend to have less inhibitory control task-irrelevant learning occurs with a feature whose signal is much greater than the threshold (Chang et al, 2014, Current Biol). From all of these results, we conclude that attention and reward play important but different roles in PL. I will further discuss different stages and phases in mechanisms of PL (Seitz et al, 2005, PNAS; Yotsumoto, Watanabe & Sasaki, Neuron, 2008; Yotsumoto et al, Curr Biol, 2009; Watanabe & Sasaki, 2015, Ann Rev Psychol; Shibata et al, 2017, Nat Neurosci; Tamaki et al, 2020, Nat Neurosci).", "hosted_by": "McGill Killam Neuro", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "b0ebcdd03fb4f9d14331971804ed8aaaf7639d5a4c03d176ed6e8b705bfa95e6", "seminar_id": 670, "time_of_addition": "Tue, Sep 15, 2020 18:05"}, "720": {"seminar_date": "Tue, Sep 29, 2020", "seminar_time": "16:00", "timezone": "Canada/Eastern", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/channels/event/killam-seminar-series-dopamine-synapse-and-learning-324619", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "https://vimeo.com/event/266553", "speaker_title": "Dr.", "seminar_speaker": "David Sulzer", "speaker_affil": "", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_website": "", "topic_tags": "striatum, dopamine, avoidance learning", "seminar_title": "The Dopamine Synapse and Learning", "seminar_abstract": "The actions of dopamine within the striatum are central to the selection of cortical and perhaps thalamic inputs that mediate learning throughout life, including during operant conditioning, reward and avoidance learning and the establishment of motor patterns.

Programmed axon death (Wallerian degeneration) is a widely-occurring mechanism of axon loss that is well understood and preventable in animals. Its aberrant activation by mutation of the pro-survival gene Nmnat2 directly causes axonopathy in mice with severity ranging from mild polyneuropathy to perinatal lethality. Rare biallelic mutations in the homologous human gene cause related phenotypes in patients. NMNAT2 is a negative regulator of the prodegenerative NADase SARM1. Constitutive activation of SARM1 is cytotoxic and the human SARM1 locus is significantly associated with sporadic ALS. Another negative regulator, STMN2, has also been implicated in ALS, where it is commonly depleted downstream of TDP-43. In mice, programmed axon death can be robustly blocked by deletion of Sarm1, or by overexpression, axonal targeting and/or stabilization of various NMNAT isoforms. This alleviates models of many human disorders including some forms of peripheral neuropathy, motor neuron diseases, glaucoma, Parkinson\u2019s disease and traumatic brain injury, and it confers lifelong rescue on the lethal Nmnat2 null phenotype and other conditions. Drug discovery programs now aim to achieve similar outcomes in human disease. In order to optimize the use of such drugs, we have characterized a range of human NMNAT2 and SARM1 functional variants that underlie a spectrum of axon vulnerability in the human population. Individuals at the vulnerable end of this spectrum are those most likely to benefit from drugs blocking programmed axon death, and disorders associated with these genotypes are promising indications in which to apply them.", "hosted_by": "McGill Killam Neuro", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "6eae4eedfa1e21b436b4d9f3908668fc1ed641d3692cf4dea25a2f3ddd1cd71b", "seminar_id": 1157, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Oct 05, 2020 18:25"}, "810": {"seminar_date": "Tue, Mar 17, 2020", "seminar_time": "12:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://zoom.us/j/7644908050", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Ethan M.

Prior studies in mouse models of Dravet syndrome (Scn1a+/- mice) at early developmental time points indicate that, in cerebral cortex, Nav1.1 is predominantly expressed in GABAergic interneurons (INs) and, in particular, in parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking basket cells (PV-INs). This has led to a model of Dravet syndrome pathogenesis whereby Nav1.1 mutation leads to preferential IN dysfunction, decreased synaptic inhibition, hyperexcitability, and epilepsy. We found that, at later developmental time points, the intrinsic excitability of PV-INs has essentially normalized, via compensatory reorganization of axonal Na+ channels. Instead, we found persistent and seemingly paradoxical dysfunction of putative disinhibitory INs expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP-INs). In vivo two-photon calcium imaging in neocortex during temperature-induced seizures in Scn1a+/- mice showed that mean activity of both putative principal cells and PV-INs was higher in Scn1a+/- relative to wild-type controls during quiet wakefulness at baseline and at elevated core body temperature. However, wild-type PV-INs showed a progressive synchronization in response to temperature elevation that was absent in PV-INs from Scn1a+/- mice immediately prior to seizure onset.

Here, we show that if synaptic plasticity is regulated by high-frequency bursts of spikes, then neurons higher in the hierarchy can coordinate the plasticity of lower-level connections. Using simulations and mathematical analyses, we demonstrate that, when paired with short-term synaptic dynamics, regenerative activity in the apical dendrites, and synaptic plasticity in feedback pathways, a burst-dependent learning rule can solve challenging tasks that require deep network architectures.

Such normally adaptive behavioural state transitions can become maladaptive in disorders such as depression. We developed a new class of multi-region recurrent neural network (RNN) models to infer brain-wide interactions driving such maladaptive behaviour. The models were trained to match experimental data across two levels simultaneously: brain-wide neural dynamics from 10-40,000 neurons and the realtime behaviour of the fish. Analysis of the trained RNN models revealed a specific change in inter-area connectivity between the habenula (Hb) and raphe nucleus during the transition into passivity. We then characterized the multi-region neural dynamics underlying this transition. Using the interaction weights derived from the RNN models, we calculated the input currents from different brain regions to each Hb neuron. We then computed neural manifolds spanning these input currents across all Hb neurons to define subspaces within the Hb activity that captured communication with each other brain region independently. At the onset of stress, there was an immediate response within the Hb/raphe subspace alone. However, RNN models identified no early or fast-timescale change in the strengths of interactions between these regions. As the animal lapsed into passivity, the responses within the Hb/raphe subspace decreased, accompanied by a concomitant change in the interactions between the raphe and Hb inferred from the RNN weights. This innovative combination of network modeling and neural dynamics analysis points to dual mechanisms with distinct timescales driving the behavioural state transition: early response to stress is mediated by reshaping the neural dynamics within a preserved network architecture, while long-term state changes correspond to altered connectivity between neural ensembles in distinct brain regions.", "hosted_by": "The Neurotheory Forum", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "eb81ba08f3baf84fe4dd30388329dd511241eb763d8a3a30c4bcc0c36809ceec", "seminar_id": 813, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Sep 28, 2020 11:06"}, "814": {"seminar_date": "Thu, Apr 23, 2020", "seminar_time": "16:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://www.crowdcast.io/e/denis-jabaudons-world", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgEPbp0JwKA", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Denis Jabaudon", "speaker_affil": "University of Geneva", "speaker_twitter": "@denisjabaudon", "speaker_website": "https://neurocenter-unige.ch/research-groups/denis-jabaudon/", "topic_tags": "development", "seminar_title": "Fate and freedom in developing neocortical circuits", "seminar_abstract": "During brain development, neurons are born in specialized niches and migrate to target regions where they assemble to form the circuits that underlie mammalian behaviour.

They allow us to identify different regimes of amplitude excursions, and to highlight the supportive role that network finite-size effects and noisy inputs to the EI network can have. We discuss how burst attributes, such as their durations and peak frequency content, depend on the network parameters.  In practice, the problem above follows the a priori challenge of fitting such E-I spiking networks to single neuron or population data. Thus, the second part of the talk will discuss a novel method to fit mesoscale dynamics using single neuron data along with a low-dimensional, and hence statistically tractable, single neuron model. The mesoscopic representation is obtained by approximating a population of neurons as multiple homogeneous \u2018pools\u2019 of neurons, and modelling the dynamics of the aggregate population activity within each pool. We derive the likelihood of both single-neuron and connectivity parameters given this activity, which can then be used to either optimize parameters by gradient ascent on the log-likelihood, or to perform Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We illustrate this approach using an E-I network of generalized integrate-and-fire neurons for which mesoscopic dynamics have been previously derived. We show that both single-neuron and connectivity parameters can be adequately recovered from simulated data.", "hosted_by": "The Neurotheory Forum", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "a9ef01f37f5306847922baffb0d613d0b3ad4d895e5250752807b7c616469a30", "seminar_id": 815, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Sep 28, 2020 11:06"}, "816": {"seminar_date": "Wed, Apr 29, 2020", "seminar_time": "14:00", "timezone": "Europe/London", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://www.crowdcast.io/e/sara-sollas-world-wide", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "https://www.crowdcast.io/e/sara-sollas-world-wide", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Sara Solla", "speaker_affil": "Northwestern University", "speaker_twitter": "@SaraASolla", "speaker_website": "https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=16584", "topic_tags": "theory, dynamical systems", "seminar_title": "Neural manifolds for the stable control of movement", "seminar_abstract": "Animals perform learned actions with remarkable consistency for years after acquiring a skill.

The time-dependent activation of the neural modes results in latent dynamics. We hypothesize that the latent dynamics associated with the consistent execution of a behaviour need to remain stable, and use an alignment method to establish this stability.

This capacity for vocal turn-taking is exhibited by non-linguistic species as well, however the neural circuit mechanisms that enable us to regulate the precise timing of our vocalizations during interactions are unknown. We aim to identify the neural mechanisms underlying the coordination of vocal interactions. Therefore, we paired zebra finches with a vocal robot (1Hz call playback) and measured the bird\u2019s call response times. We found that individual birds called with a stereotyped delay in respect to the robot call. Pharmacological inactivation of the premotor nucleus HVC revealed its necessity for the temporal coordination of calls. We further investigated the contributing neural activity within HVC by performing intracellular recordings from premotor neurons and inhibitory interneurons in calling zebra finches. We found that inhibition is preceding excitation before and during call onset. To test whether inhibition guides call timing we pharmacologically limited the impact of inhibition on premotor neurons. As a result zebra finches converged on a similar delay time i.e. birds called more rapidly after the vocal robot call suggesting that HVC inhibitory interneurons regulate the coordination of social contact calls.  \n\nIn addition, we aim to investigate the vocal turn-taking capabilities of the common nightingale. Male nightingales learn over 100 different song motifs which are being used in order to attract mates or defend territories. Previously, it has been shown that nightingales counter-sing with each other following a similar temporal structure to human vocal turn-taking. These animals are also able to spontaneously imitate a motif of another nightingale. The neural mechanisms underlying this behaviour are not yet understood.

Surprisingly (at least for us), we found that prominent features of inhibitory circuitry can be accounted for by an optimisation for excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance.

Moreover, an optimisation for E/I balance across neuronal compartments promotes a functional diversification of interneurons into two classes that resemble parvalbumin and somatostatin-positive interneurons.

These advances are largely aimed at enabling us to understand precisely how neural circuit computations mechanistically cause behavior. Establishing this type of causal understanding will require multiple perturbational (e.g optogenetic) experiments. It has been unclear exactly how many such experiments are needed and how this number scales with the size of the nervous system in question. Here, using techniques from Theoretical Computer Science, we prove that establishing the most extensive notions of understanding need exponentially-many experiments in the number of neurons, in many cases, unless a widely-posited hypothesis about computation is false (i.e. unless P = NP). Furthermore, using data and estimates, we demonstrate that the feasible experimental regime is typically one where the number of experiments performable scales sub-linearly in the number of neurons in the nervous system. This remarkable gulf between the worst-case and the feasible suggests an algorithmic barrier to such an understanding. Determining which notions of understanding are algorithmically tractable to establish in what contexts, thus, becomes an important new direction for investigation. TL; DR: Non-existence of tractable algorithms for neural circuit interrogation could pose a barrier to comprehensively understanding how neural circuits cause behavior.

The mechanisms that underlie the interaction between these \u201cwireless\u201d non-synaptic signals and the \u201cwired\u201d cortical circuit are not well understood.

"seminar_title": "On the purpose and origin of spontaneous neural activity", "seminar_abstract": "Spontaneous firing, observed in many neurons, is often attributed to ion channel or network level noise. Cortical cells during slow wave sleep exhibit transitions between so called Up and Down states. In this sleep state, with limited sensory stimuli, neurons fire in the Up state. Spontaneous firing is also observed in slices of cholinergic interneurons, cerebellar Purkinje cells and even brainstem inspiratory neurons. In such in vitro preparations, where the functional relevance is long lost, neurons continue to display a rich repertoire of firing properties. It is perplexing that these neurons, instead of saving their energy during information downtime and functional irrelevance, are eager to fire. We propose that spontaneous firing is not a chance event but instead, a vital activity for the well-being of a neuron. We postulate that neurons, in anticipation of synaptic inputs, keep their ATP levels at maximum. As recovery from inputs requires most of the energy resources, neurons are ATP surplus and ADP scarce during synaptic quiescence. With ADP as the rate-limiting step, ATP production stalls in the mitochondria when ADP is low. This leads to toxic Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) formation, which are known to disrupt many cellular processes. We hypothesize that spontaneous firing occurs at these conditions - as a release valve to spend energy and to restore ATP production, shielding the neuron against ROS. By linking a mitochondrial metabolism model to a conductance-based neuron model, we show that spontaneous firing depends on baseline ATP usage and on ATP-cost-per-spike. From our model, emerges a mitochondrial mediated homeostatic mechanism that provides a recipe for different firing patterns. Our findings, though mostly affecting intracellular dynamics, may have large knock-on effects on the nature of neural coding. Hitherto it has been thought that the neural code is optimised for energy minimisation, but this may be true only when neurons do not experience synaptic quiescence.", "hosted_by": "NYU Swartz", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "c9485dafa2d85aa859cb428f2570e6aba154aa07370dc6632c48b074f3aa6274", "seminar_id": 862, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Sep 28, 2020 11:07"}, "375": {"seminar_date": "Fri, Sep 25, 2020", "seminar_time": "12:00", "timezone": "America/New_York", "posted": "YES", "seminar_link": "https://www.crowdcast.io/e/qybj7tz8", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "https://youtu.be/G3y-osyLTwk", "speaker_title": "Prof.", "seminar_speaker": "Rishidev Chaudhuri", "speaker_affil": "University of California, Davis", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_website": "https://chaudhurilab.ucdavis.edu/", "topic_tags": "theory", "seminar_title": "Using noise to probe recurrent neural network structure and prune synapses", "seminar_abstract": "Many networks in the brain are sparsely connected, and the brain eliminates synapses during development and learning. How could the brain decide which synapses to prune? In a recurrent network, determining the importance of a synapse between two neurons is a difficult computational problem, depending on the role that both neurons play and on all possible pathways of information flow between them. Noise is ubiquitous in neural systems, and often considered an irritant to be overcome. In the first part of this talk, I will suggest that noise could play a functional role in synaptic pruning, allowing the brain to probe network structure and determine which synapses are redundant. I will introduce a simple, local, unsupervised plasticity rule that either strengthens or prunes synapses using only synaptic weight and the noise-driven covariance of the neighboring neurons. For a subset of linear and rectified-linear networks, this rule provably preserves the spectrum of the original matrix and hence preserves network dynamics even when the fraction of pruned synapses asymptotically approaches 1. The plasticity rule is biologically-plausible and may suggest a new role for noise in neural computation. Time permitting, I will then turn to the problem of extracting structure from neural population data sets using dimensionality reduction methods. I will argue that nonlinear structures naturally arise in neural data and show how these nonlinearities cause linear methods of dimensionality reduction, such as Principal Components Analysis, to fail dramatically in identifying low-dimensional structure.", "hosted_by": "NYU Swartz", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "9977c53ecb75a4031ac968ef832733420140ea9ceecd9fdbd9828fa54011d583", "seminar_id": 375, "time_of_addition": "Sat, Jul 18, 2020 00:17"}, "863": {"seminar_date": "Fri, Oct 16, 2020", "seminar_time": "12:00", "timezone": "America/New_York", "posted": "YES", "seminar_link": "https://www.crowdcast.io/e/stefano-fusi", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "speaker_title": "Prof.", "seminar_speaker": "Stefano Fusi", "speaker_affil": "Columbia University", "speaker_twitter": "@StefanoFusi2", "speaker_website": "https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/people/stefano-fusi", "topic_tags": "theory", "seminar_title": "The geometry of abstraction in hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex", "seminar_abstract": "The curse of dimensionality plagues models of reinforcement learning and decision-making. The process of abstraction solves this by constructing abstract variables describing features shared by different specific instances, reducing dimensionality and enabling generalization in novel situations. Here we characterized neural representations in monkeys performing a task where a hidden variable described the temporal statistics of stimulus-response-outcome mappings. Abstraction was defined operationally using the generalization performance of neural decoders across task conditions not used for training. This type of generalization requires a particular geometric format of neural representations. Neural ensembles in dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus, and in simulated neural networks, simultaneously represented multiple hidden and explicit variables in a format reflecting abstraction. Task events engaging cognitive operations modulated this format.

Here I discuss recent work from the lab in which we followed this FR homeostasis in individual V1 neurons in freely behaving animals during a prolonged visual deprivation/eye-reopening paradigm. We find that - when FRs are perturbed by manipulating sensory experience - over time they return precisely to a cell-autonomous set-point. Finally, we find that homeostatic plasticity is perturbed in a mouse model of Autism spectrum disorder, and this results in a breakdown of FRH within V1. These data suggest that loss of homeostatic plasticity is one primary cause of excitation/inhibition imbalances in ASD models. Together these studies illuminate the role of stabilizing plasticity mechanisms in the ability of neocortical circuits to recover robust function following challenges to their excitability.",

In this talk, I will discuss my lab\u2019s findings on how the human brain supports spatial memory and navigation based on our experiments with direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients performing virtual-reality spatial memory tasks. I will show that humans have a network of neurons that represent where we are located and trying to go. This network includes some cell types that are similar to those seen in animals, such as place and grid cells, as well as others that have not been seen before in animals, such as anchor and spatial-target cells. I also will explore the role of network oscillations in human memory, where humans again show several distinctive patterns compared to animals. Whereas rodents generally show a hippocampal oscillation at ~8Hz, humans have two separate hippocampal oscillations, at low and high frequencies, which support memory and navigation, respectively. Finally, I will show that neural oscillations in humans are traveling waves, propagating across the cortex, to coordinate the timing of neuronal activity across regions, which is another property not seen in animals. A theme from this work is that in terms of navigation and memory the human brain has novel characteristics compared with animals, which helps explain our rich behavioural abilities and has implications for treating disease and neurological disorders.", "hosted_by": "BCCN Berlin", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "82c7aaf6e567c636f878c29cf9db459c0bf3c892676d51cb61e6f81618402e7d", "seminar_id": 804, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Sep 28, 2020 11:06"}, "337": {"seminar_date": "Wed, July 8, 2020", "seminar_time": "16:00", "timezone": "Europe/Berlin", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://hu-berlin.zoom.us/j/92652527827", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "speaker_title": "Prof.", "seminar_speaker": "Martin Giese", "speaker_affil": "University of T\u00fcbingen", "speaker_twitter": "@Compens", "speaker_website": "http://www.compsens.uni-tuebingen.de/compsens/index.php/publications/patents?publications_view_all=1&theses_view_all=0&projects_view_all=0&task=show&view=member&id=1", "topic_tags": "sensorimotor control, high level vision", "seminar_title": "Neural and computational principles of the processing of dynamic faces and bodies", "seminar_abstract": "Body motion is a fundamental signal of social communication. This includes facial as well as full-body movements. Combining advanced methods from computer animation with motion capture in humans and monkeys, we synthesized highly-realistic monkey avatar models. Our face avatar is perceived by monkeys as almost equivalent to a real animal, and does not induce an \u2018uncanny valley effect\u2019, unlike all other previously used avatar models in studies with monkeys. Applying machine-learning methods for the control of motion style, we were able to investigate how species-specific shape and dynamic cues influence the perception of human and monkey facial expressions. Human observers showed very fast learning of monkey expressions, and a perceptual encoding of expression dynamics that was largely independent of facial shape. This result is in line with the fact that facial shape evolved faster than the neuromuscular control in primate phylogenesis. At the same time, it challenges popular neural network models of the recognition of dynamic faces that assume a joint encoding of facial shape and dynamics. We propose an alternative physiologically-inspired neural model that realizes such an orthogonal encoding of facial shape and expression from video sequences.\n\nAs second example, we investigated the perception of social interactions from abstract stimuli, similar to the ones by Heider & Simmel (1944), and also from more realistic stimuli. We developed and validated a new generative model for the synthesis of such social interaction, which is based on a modification of human navigation model. We demonstrate that the recognition of such stimuli, including the perception of agency, can be accounted for by a relatively elementary physiologically-inspired hierarchical neural recognition model, that does not require the assumption of sophisticated inference mechanisms, as postulated by some cognitive theories of social recognition.\n\nSummarizing, this suggests that essential phenomena in social cognition might be accounted for by a small set of simple neural principles that can be easily implemented by cortical circuits. The developed technologies for stimulus control form the basis of electrophysiological studies that can verify specific neural circuits, as the ones proposed by our theoretical models.", "hosted_by": "BCCN Berlin", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "3d82935e37fff9c1d8df81f66a36205ca73ec2382e1405c6340527093290810a", "seminar_id": 337, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Jul 06, 2020 15:18"}, "355": {"seminar_date": "Wed, July 15, 2020", "seminar_time": "16:00", "timezone": "Europe/Berlin", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://tu-berlin.zoom.us/j/92147414281?pwd=UFBjQ0ZGUWJTMDh0dlB0MkRwazhSUT09", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "speaker_title": "PhD", "seminar_speaker": "Terry Stewart", "speaker_affil": "University of Waterloo and National Research Center Canada", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_website": "http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/people/terrence-c-stewart.html", "topic_tags": "nengo", "seminar_title": "Using Nengo and the Neural Engineering Framework to Represent Time and Space", "seminar_abstract": "The Neural Engineering Framework (and the associated software tool Nengo) provide a general method for converting algorithms into neural networks with an adjustable level of biological plausibility.

For cortical circuits the understanding is much more limited. Most network studies have considered stylized models with a single or a handful of neuronal populations consisting of identical neurons with statistically identical connection properties. However, real cortical networks have heterogeneous neural populations and much more structured synaptic connections. Unlike typical simplified cortical network models, real networks are also \u201cmultipurpose\u201d in that they perform multiple functions.  \n  \nHistorically the lack of computational resources has hampered the mathematical exploration of cortical networks.  With the advent of modern supercomputers, however, simulations of networks comprising hundreds of thousands biologically detailed neurons are becoming feasible (Einevoll et al, Neuron, 2019). Further, a large-scale biologically network model of the mouse primary visual cortex comprising 230.000 neurons has recently been developed at the Allen Institute for Brain Science (Billeh et al, Neuron, 2020). Using this model as a starting point, I will discuss how we can move towards multipurpose models that incorporate the true biological complexity of cortical circuits and faithfully reproduce multiple experimental observables such as spiking activity, local field potentials or two-photon calcium imaging signals. Further, I will discuss how such validated comprehensive network models can be used to gain insights into the functioning of cortical circuits.", "hosted_by": "BCCN Berlin", "domain":

Neuronal activity mapping and site-specific functional suppression in mice identified the central part of the medial preoptic area (cMPOA) as the hub of caregiving network for both mothers and fathers.Recent findings about the neural circuit and molecular signaling involved in caregiving motivation will be discussed.", "hosted_by": "Champalimaud Colloquia", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "d30563f40705f1478b214353be3452e653f30c1581965e28a186edd56e17a1c8", "seminar_id": 667, "time_of_addition": "Tue, Sep 15, 2020 14:46"}, "668": {"seminar_date": "Thu, Jul 23, 2020", "seminar_time": "14:00", "timezone": "Europe/Lisbon", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://champalimaud-research.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_sBLYOz9dQsquZ1nyeLIz_Q", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Ansgar B\u00fcschges", "speaker_affil": "Department of Animal Physiology, Institute of Zoology, University of Cologne", "speaker_twitter": "@bueschges_lab", "speaker_website": "https://zoologie.uni-koeln.de/arbeitsgruppen/ag-bueschges", "topic_tags": "neural control, locomotion", "seminar_title": "The complexity of the ordinary \u2013 neural control of locomotion", "seminar_abstract": "Today, considerable information is available on the organization and operation of the neural networks that generate the motor output for animal locomotion, such as swimming, walking, or flying. In recent years, the question of which neural mechanisms are responsible for task-specific and flexible adaptations of locomotor patterns has gained increased attention in the field of motor control. I will report on advances we made with respect to this topic for walking in insects, i.e. the leg muscle control system of phasmids and fruit flies. I will present insights into the neural basis of speed control, heading, walking direction, and the role of ground contact in insect walking, both for local control and intersegmental coordination. For these changes in motor activity modifications in the processing of sensory feedback signals play a pivotal role, for instance for movement and load signals in heading and curve walking or for movement signals that contribute to intersegmental coordination.

Here we monitor the state of activity of the animal through videography of the face, including pupil and whisker movements, as well as walking, while also monitoring the ability of the animal to perform a difficult auditory or visual task.  We find that the state of the animal is continuously changing and is never stable.  The animal is constantly becoming more or less activated (aroused) on a second and subsecond scale.  These changes in state are reflected in all of the neural systems we have measured, including cortical, thalamic, and neuromodulatory activity.  Rapid changes in cortical activity are highly correlated with changes in neural responses to sensory stimuli and the ability of the animal to perform auditory or visual detection tasks.  On the intracellular level, these changes in forebrain activity are associated with large changes in neuronal membrane potential and the nature of network activity (e.g. from slow rhythm generation to sustained activation and depolarization).  Monitoring cholinergic and noradrenergic axonal activity reveals widespread correlations across the cortex.  However, we suggest that a significant component of these rapid state changes arise from glutamatergic pathways (e.g. corticocortical or thalamocortical), owing to their rapidity.

However, little is known about the circuit or anatomical underpinnings of this individuality, though previous work implicates sensory periphery. Drosophila olfaction presents an ideal model to study the biological basis of behavioral individuality, because while the neural circuit underlying olfactory behavior is well-described and highly stereotyped, persistent idiosyncrasy in behavior, neural coding, and neural wiring have also been described. Projection neurons (PNs), which relay odor signals sensed by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) to deeper brain structures, exhibit variable calcium responses to identical odor stimuli across individuals, but how these idiosyncrasies relate to individual behavioral responses remains unknown. Here, using paired behavior and two-photon imaging measurements, we show that idiosyncratic calcium dynamics in both ORNs and PNs predict individual preferences for an aversive monomolecular odorant versus air, suggesting that variation at the periphery of the olfactory system determines individual preference for an odor\u2019s presence. In contrast, PN, but not ORN, calcium responses predict individual preferences in a two-odor choice assay. Furthermore, paired behavior and immunohistochemistry measurements reveal that variation in ORN presynaptic density also predicts two-odor preference, suggesting this site is a locus of individuality where microscale circuit variation gives rise to idiosyncrasy in behavior.

We investigated how the brain coordinates its activity across areas to inform complex, top-down control behaviors. Animals were trained to perform a novel brain machine interface task to guide a visual cursor to a reward zone, using activity recorded with widefield calcium imaging. This allowed us to screen for cortical areas implicated in causal neural control of the visual object. Animals could decorrelate normally highly-correlated areas to perform the task, and used an explore-exploit search in neural activity space to discover successful strategies. Higher visual and parietal areas were more active during the task in expert animals.

surging interest in inter-individual differences, with a focus on individuals with superior skills, so-called Super-Recognizers (SRs; Ramon et al., 2019; Russell et al., 2009). Their study can provide valuable insights into brain-behavior relationships and advance our understanding of neural functioning. Despite a decade of research, and similarly to the field of developmental prosopagnosia, a consensus on diagnostic criteria for SR identification is lacking. Consequently, SRs are currently identified either inconsistently, via suboptimal individual tests, or via undocumented collections of tests. This state of the field has two major implications. Firstly, our scientific understanding of SRs will remain at best limited. Secondly, the needs of government agencies interested in deploying SRs for real-life identity verification (e.g., policing) are unlikely to be met. To counteract these issues, I suggest the following action points. Firstly, based on our and others\u2019 work suggesting novel and challenging tests of face cognition (Bobak et al., 2019; Fysh et al., in press; Stacchi et al., 2019), and my collaborations with international security agencies, I recommend novel diagnostic criteria for SR identification. These are currently being used to screen the Berlin State Police\u2019s >25K employees before identifying SRs via bespoke testing procedures we have collaboratively developed over the past years. Secondly, I introduce a cohort of SRs identified using these criteria, which is being studied in-depth using behavioral methods, psychophysics, eye-tracking, and neuroimaging. Finally, I suggest data acquired for these individuals should be curated to develop and share best practices with researchers and practitioners, and to gain an accurate and transparent description of SR cases to exploit their informative value.", "hosted_by": "BIU Vision Science", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "e2da02a439812766843ef9f76de74a05104e5a6ffc281daac1af99f3cc3912fc", "seminar_id": 412, "time_of_addition": "Thu, Jul 30, 2020 13:05"}, "418": {"seminar_date": "Tue, Sep 1, 2020", "seminar_time": "15:00", "timezone": "Israel", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://zoom.us/j/91790244801", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "https://youtu.be/vEP0x_RIl0M", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Tony Movshon", "speaker_affil": "NYU", "speaker_twitter": "@TonyMovshon", "speaker_website": "https://as.nyu.edu/cns/people/faculty.j-anthony-movshon.html", "topic_tags": "vision, visual science, electrophysiology, motion, MT/V5, perception", "seminar_title": "Brain mechanisms of visual form perception", "seminar_abstract": "", "hosted_by": "BIU Vision Science", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "76a2865f57c06990ea4ff6c4fae3e7eb0d14764967839b256a479020c6fa99a6", "seminar_id": 418, "time_of_addition": "Thu, Aug 06, 2020 00:45"}, "419": {"seminar_date": "Tue, Sep 8, 2020", "seminar_time": "15:00", "timezone": "Israel", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://zoom.us/j/97615934514", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "https://youtu.be/EbFkPk7Q3Z8", "speaker_title": "Prof", "seminar_speaker": "Mel Goodale", "speaker_affil": "Western University", "speaker_twitter": "@action_brain", "speaker_website": "https://www.uwo.ca/bmi/goodalelab/", "topic_tags": "vision, visual science, cognitive science, perception", "seminar_title": "How big is that banana?

However, our research poses some outstanding questions.  We will briefly discuss three issues, which are linked by a common focus on the development of visual attentional processing:    (1) How do recurrent cortical loops contribute to development?  Cortical selectivity (e.g., to orientation, motion, and binocular disparity) develops in the early months of life.  However, these systems are not purely feedforward but depend on parallel pathways, with recurrent feedback loops playing a critical role.  The development of diverse networks, particularly for motion processing, may explain changes in dynamic responses and resolve developmental data obtained with different methodologies.  One possible role for these loops is in top-down attentional control of visual processing. (2) Why do hyperopic infants become strabismic (cross-eyes)?  Binocular interaction is a particularly sensitive area of development.  Standard clinical accounts suppose that long-sighted (hyperopic) refractive errors require accommodative effort, putting stress on the accommodation-convergence link that leads to its breakdown and strabismus.   Our large-scale population screening studies of 9-month infants question this:  hyperopic infants are at higher risk of strabismus and impaired vision (amblyopia and impaired attention) but these hyperopic infants often under- rather than over-accommodate.  This poor accommodation may reflect poor early attention processing, possibly a \u2018soft sign\u2019 of subtle cerebral dysfunction. (3) What do many neurodevelopmental disorders have in common? Despite similar cognitive demands, global motion perception is much more impaired than global static form across diverse neurodevelopmental disorders including Down and Williams Syndromes, Fragile-X, Autism, children with premature birth and infants with perinatal brain injury. These deficits in motion processing are associated with deficits in other dorsal stream functions such as visuo-motor co-ordination and attentional control, a cluster we have called \u2018dorsal stream vulnerability\u2019.  However, our neuroimaging measures related to motion coherence in typically developing children suggest that the critical areas for individual differences in global motion sensitivity are not early motion-processing areas such as V5/MT, but downstream parietal and frontal areas for decision processes on motion signals.  Although these brain networks  may also underlie attentional and visuo-motor deficits , we still do not know when and how these deficits  differ across different disorders and between individual children.    Answering these questions provide necessary steps, not only increasing our scientific understanding of human visual brain development,  but also in designing appropriate  interventions to help each child achieve their full potential.", "hosted_by": "BIU Vision Science", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "c00c5b7c2c7e9d11fa791c26d23e34ce7c8762e550012998b6eef0e39e049efe",

numbers of neurons interconnected in vast networks, strongly suggest that they are specifically build to generate emergent functional properties (1). To explore this hypothesis, we have developed two-photon holographic methods to selective image and manipulate the activity of neuronal populations in 3D in vivo (2). Using them we find that groups of synchronous neurons (neuronal ensembles) dominate the evoked and spontaneous activity of mouse primary visual cortex (3). Ensembles can be optogenetically imprinted for several days and some of their neurons trigger the entire ensemble (4). By activating these pattern completion cells in ensembles involved in visual discrimination paradigms, we can bi-directionally alter behavioural choices (5).  Our results demonstrate that ensembles are necessary and sufficient for visual perception and are consistent with the possibility that neuronal ensembles are the functional building blocks of cortical circuits. \n\n1.\tR.

Quantitative predictions about biological systems have been successfully derived from first principles in the context of efficient coding, metabolic and transport networks, evolution, reinforcement learning, and decision making, by postulating that a system has evolved to optimize some utility function under biophysical constraints. Yet as normative theories become increasingly high-dimensional and optimal solutions stop being unique, it gets progressively hard to judge whether theoretical predictions are consistent with, or \"close to\", data. I will illustrate these issues using efficient coding applied to simple neuronal models as well as to a complex and realistic biochemical reaction network.

A particularly striking example is information seeking behavior: animals often seek out sensory cues that will inform them about the properties of uncertain future rewards, even when there is no way for them to use this information to influence the reward outcome, and even when this information comes at a considerable cost. Evidence from monkey electrophysiology and human fMRI studies suggests that orbitofrontal cortex and midbrain dopamine neurons represent the subjective value of knowledge during information seeking behavior. However, it remains unclear how the brain assigns value to information and how it integrates this with other incentives to drive behavior. We have therefore developed a task to test if information preferences are present in mice and study how informational value is imparted on stimuli. Mice are trained to enter a center port and receive an initial odor that instructs them to either go to an informative side port, go to an uninformative side port, or choose freely between them. The chosen side port then yields a second odor cue followed by a delayed probabilistic water reward. The informative port\u2019s odor cue indicates whether the upcoming reward will be big or small. The uninformative port\u2019s odor cue is uncorrelated with the trial outcome. Crucially, the two ports only differ in their odor cues, not in their water value since both offer identical probabilities of big and small rewards. We find that mice prefer the informative port. This preference is evident as a higher percentage choice of the informative port when given a free choice (67% +/- 1.7%, n = 14, p < 0.03), as well as by faster reaction times when instructed to go to the informative port (544ms +/- 21ms vs 795ms +/- 21ms, n = 14, p < 0.001). The preference for information is robust to within-animal reversals of informative and uninformative port locations, and, moreover, mice are willing to pay for information by choosing the informative port even if its reward amount is reduced to be substantially lower than the uninformative port. These behavioral observations suggest that odor stimuli are imparted with informational value as mice learn the information seeking task. We are currently imaging neural activity in orbitofrontal cortex with microendoscopes to identify changes in neural activity that may reflect value associated with the acquisition of knowledge.", "hosted_by": "Transatlantic Systems Neuro", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "eed4e2698531ad1da015c173df4a1afc4db72f32027eac9a4b9700e40f606791", "seminar_id": 1161, "time_of_addition": "Tue, Oct 06, 2020 12:30"}, "1162": {"seminar_date": "Wed, Jul 29, 2020", "seminar_time": "14:30", "timezone": "Europe/London", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://us02web.zoom.us/j/194382755?pwd=NUlaQVo4b0xLVE0xNGJmSDhoenA3Zz09", "password": "nol1917", "video_on_demand": "", "speaker_title": "", "seminar_speaker": "Duda Kvitsiani", "speaker_affil": "Aarhus University", "speaker_twitter": "@DudaKvitsiani", "speaker_website": "https://dandrite.au.dk/people/group-leaders/kvitsiani-group/", "topic_tags": "drosophila foraging", "seminar_title": "Reward foraging task, and model-based analysis reveal how fruit flies learn the value of available options", "seminar_abstract": "Understanding what drives foraging decisions in animals requires careful manipulation of the value of available options while monitoring animal choices. Value-based decision-making tasks, in combination with formal learning models, have provided both an experimental and theoretical framework to study foraging decisions in lab settings. While these approaches were successfully used in the past to understand what drives choices in mammals, very little work has been done on fruit flies. This is even though fruit flies have served as a model organism for many complex behavioural paradigms. To fill this gap we developed a single-animal, trial-based decision-making task, where freely walking flies experienced optogenetic sugar-receptor neuron stimulation. We controlled the value of available options by manipulating the probabilities of optogenetic stimulation. We show that flies integrate a reward history of chosen options and forget value of unchosen options. We further discover that flies assign higher values to rewards experienced early in the behavioural session, consistent with formal reinforcement learning models. Finally, we show that the probabilistic rewards affect walking trajectories of flies, suggesting that accumulated value is controlling the navigation vector of flies in a graded fashion. These findings establish the fruit fly as a model organism to explore the genetic and circuit basis of value-based decisions.", "hosted_by": "Transatlantic Systems Neuro", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "7c67ae81df5dd935c18a53f1e8d6f1d0cf1fef905f619b1feccb29e5536f62a3", "seminar_id": 1162, "time_of_addition": "Tue, Oct 06, 2020 12:30"}, "1163": {"seminar_date": "Wed, Sep 9, 2020", "seminar_time": "14:30", "timezone": "Europe/London", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://us02web.zoom.us/j/194382755?pwd=c2I4bGx3Nnloa2pNQ3ZvaDg5WldPdz09", "password": "nol1917", "video_on_demand": "", "speaker_title": "", "seminar_speaker": "Arkarup Banerjee", "speaker_affil": "NYU Langone medical center", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_website": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VrbcQ7QAAAAJ&hl=en", "topic_tags": "", "seminar_title": "Motor Cortical Control of Vocal Interactions in a Neotropical Singing Mouse", "seminar_abstract": "Using sounds for social interactions is common across many taxa. Humans engaged in conversation, for\nexample, take rapid turns to go back and forth. This ability to act upon sensory information to generate a\ndesired motor output is a fundamental feature of animal behavior. How the brain enables such flexible\nsensorimotor transformations, for example during vocal interactions, is a central question in neuroscience.\nSeeking a rodent model to fill this niche, we are investigating neural mechanisms of vocal interaction in\nAlston\u2019s singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina) \u2013 a neotropical rodent native to the cloud forests of Central\nAmerica. We discovered sub-second temporal coordination of advertisement songs (counter-singing)\nbetween males of this species \u2013 a behavior that requires the rapid modification of motor outputs in response\nto auditory cues. We leveraged this natural behavior to probe the neural mechanisms that generate and allow\nfast and flexible vocal communication.

Work in many species has suggested that animals accomplish this task by combining temporal processing of dynamic odor information with an estimate of wind direction.\nOur lab has been using adult walking Drosophila to understand both the computational algorithms and the neural circuits that support navigation in a plume of attractive food odor.  We developed a high-throughput paradigm to study behavioural responses to temporally-controlled odor and wind stimuli.  Using this paradigm we found that flies respond to a food odor (apple cider vinegar) with two behaviours: during the odor they run upwind, while after odor loss they perform a local search.  A simple computational model based one these two responses is sufficient to replicate many aspects of fly behaviour in a natural turbulent plume. \nIn on-going work, we are seeking to identify the neural circuits and biophysical mechanisms that perform the computations delineated by our model.  Using electrophysiology, we have identified mechanosensory neurons that compute wind direction from movements of the two antennae and central mechanosensory neurons that encode wind direction are are involved in generating a stable downwind orientation.  Using optogenetic activation, we have traced olfactory circuits capable of evoking upwind orientation and offset search from the periphery, through the mushroom body and lateral horn, to the central complex.  Finally, we have used optogenetic activation, in combination with molecular manipulation of specific synapses, to localize temporal computations performed on the odor signal to olfactory transduction and transmission at specific synapses.

We approach these questions using genetic tools, in vivo two-photon imaging, and patch-clamp electrophysiology in Drosophila. We recently found that the axons of fly leg proprioceptors are organized into distinct functional projections that contain topographic representations of specific kinematic features: one group of axons encodes tibia position, another encodes movement direction, and a third encodes bidirectional movement and vibration frequency.

Response to positive feedback from olfactory interactions depends on the risk of water loss, mediated by dopamine neurophysiology.

Many of us are beginning to appreciate that perception is largely active, i.e. that information flows back and forth between the three systems modulating their respective properties.

Projection neurons (PNs), which relay odor signals sensed by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) to deeper brain structures, exhibit variable calcium responses to identical odor stimuli across individuals, but how these idiosyncrasies relate to individual behavioural responses remains unknown. Here, using paired behaviour and two-photon imaging measurements, we show that idiosyncratic calcium dynamics in both ORNs and PNs predict individual preferences for an aversive monomolecular odorant versus air, suggesting that variation at the periphery of the olfactory system determines individual preference for an odor\u2019s presence. In contrast, PN, but not ORN, calcium responses predict individual preferences in a two-odor choice assay. Furthermore, paired behaviour and immunohistochemistry measurements reveal that variation in ORN presynaptic density also predicts two-odor preference, suggesting this site is a locus of individuality where microscale circuit variation gives rise to idiosyncrasy in behaviour.

Studies of the communicative abilities of our closest living relatives, the nonhuman primates, aim to contribute to a better understanding of the emergence of this uniquely human capability. Following a brief introduction over the key building blocks that make up the human speech faculty, I will focus on the question of meaning in nonhuman primate vocalizations. While nonhuman primate calls may be highly context specific, thus giving rise to the notion of \u2018referentiality\u2019, comparisons across closely related species suggest that this specificity is evolved rather than learned. Yet, as in humans, the structure of calls varies with arousal and affective state, and there is some evidence for effects of sensory-motor integration in vocal production. Thus, the vocal production of nonhuman primates bears little resemblance to the symbolic and combinatorial features of human speech, while basic production mechanisms are shared. Listeners, in contrast, are able learning the meaning of new sounds. A recent study using artificial predator shows that this learning may be extremely rapid. Furthermore, listeners are able to integrate information from multiple sources to make adaptive decisions, which renders the vocal communication system as a whole relatively flexible and powerful. In conclusion, constraints at the side of vocal production, including limits in social cognition and motivation to share experiences, rather than constraints at the side of the recipient explain the differences in communicative abilities between humans and other animals.", "hosted_by": "Systems Neuroecology", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "cc08c155eb32dfb081df0595d0de4ee43b4d229165a1deeb5e75b75d5b3bb6c7", "seminar_id": 1117, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Oct 05, 2020 12:06"}, "1118": {"seminar_date": "Wed, Nov 4, 2020", "seminar_time": "12:00", "timezone": "America/New_York", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://www.crowdcast.io/e/eugenia-chiappe-systems", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "speaker_title": "Dr", "seminar_speaker": "Eugenia Chiappe", "speaker_affil": "Champalimaud Center for the Unknown", "speaker_twitter": "@EugeChapadur", "speaker_website": "https://chiappelab.org/", "topic_tags": "", "seminar_title": "TBD", "seminar_abstract": "TBD", "hosted_by": "Systems Neuroecology", "domain": ["Neuroscience"], "calendar_event_hash": "79db4a8ca50a87f45d35ec402404820db511e864d7d8e772e27568b99fcc2462", "seminar_id": 1118, "time_of_addition": "Mon, Oct 05, 2020 12:06"}, "1119": {"seminar_date": "Wed, Nov 25, 2020", "seminar_time": "12:00", "timezone": "America/New_York", "posted": "yes", "seminar_link": "https://www.crowdcast.io/e/yossi-yovel-systems", "password": "", "video_on_demand": "", "speaker_title": "Dr", "seminar_speaker": "Yossi Yovel", "speaker_affil": "Tel Aviv University", "speaker_twitter": "", "speaker_website": "http://www.yossiyovel.com/", "topic_tags": "spatial navigation, reinforcement learning, bats", "seminar_title": "On cognitive maps and reinforcement learning in large-scale animal behaviour", "seminar_abstract": "Bats are extreme aviators and amazing navigators. Many bat species nightly com-mute dozens of kilometres in search of food, and some bat species annually migrate over thousands of kilometres. Studying bats in their natural environment has al-ways been extremely challenging because of their small size (mostly <50 gr) and agile nature. We have recently developed novel miniature technology allowing us to GPS-tag small bats, thus opening a new window to document their behaviour in the wild. We have used this technology to track fruit-bats pups over 5 months from birth to adulthood. Following the bats\u2019 full movement history allowed us to show that they use novel short-cuts which are typical for cognitive-map based naviga-tion. In a second study, we examined how nectar-feeding bats make foraging deci-sions under competition. We show that by relying on a simple reinforcement learn-ing strategy, the bats can divide the resource between them without aggression or communication.

Similarly, we study how bees in a colony respond to environmental thermal perturbations by deploying a fanning strategy at the entrance that they use to create a forced ventilation stream that allows the bees to collectively maintain a constant hive temperature.
